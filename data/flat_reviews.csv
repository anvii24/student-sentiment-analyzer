 FHS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Nichols is super nice and very wholesome! There is a lot of reading, but you can get by without doing very much of it. He does talk a LOT and doesn't foster as much discussion, but I think the latter might also be because people stop doing the readings a few weeks in. He does appreciate participation and gives great essay feedback!",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 FHS010,3.0,1.0,Yes,No,,No,"Very chill class and teacher, very easy grader, but talks for most of the class and does not really foster discussion.",James Nichols ,Government department,Mandatory,
 POLPHILOSOPHY,4.0,1.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Awesome, easy, knows literally everything about his subject it is crazy!",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 FHS010,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Nichols is a super nice and encouraging man. And most importantly, he is extremely knowledgeable and you will learn a great deal from him. The class is pretty easy 'cause he's an easy grader. He takes rolls at the beginning of the semester but you will be fine if you don't go to this class from time to time. Highly recommend!",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 FHS10,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,Good Professor. Really nice and encouraging teacher. Class moves along at an enjoyable but swift pace.,James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,Not very difficult and the reading is not very difficult. He knows his stuff.,James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"If you aren't looking forward to taking Civ, take nichols. He doesn't hold you responsible for the reading and he is an easy grader. The assessments are reasonable and infrequent. The class is pretty boring, but it is important to go. Just regurgitate the lectures in your papers with a little extra insight and you'll do really well.",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Smart guy. Is obviously interested in the books he chose and knows alot about them. If yo don't do the reading, you can get by. It's more interesting if you do though. Was on friday at 10 which was less than ideal, but a pretty good teacher. Papers were really easy. Just pay attention in class, and expand his ideas.",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"If you don't like the idea of having to take Civ, then Nichols is the guy for you. Discussions are more like lectures, so he doesn't hold people responsible for the reading. He grades papers generously and there aren't very many of them. You won't have fun, but it won't be that  much work and you'll do decently.",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Nichols is an amazing professor--managed to make a course often regarded as filler extremely interesting.  Nichols speaks animatedly and is willing to engage students in a fast-paced, firm, yet comedic manner.  Harder than other Civ sections, but well worth the added papers/readings and final.  Very accommodating.  You will enjoy this course.",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Nichols is my favorite professor at CMC. He is so passionate about the subjects that we discuss and is always willing to discuss anything if you have questions. That being said, he is not as easy as most civ professors, but he really cares.",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Nichols is the best civ prof period,James Nichols ,Government department,,
 GOV80,4.0,3.0,,,A,,"Nichols may be a goofy bald man, but between the giggles and the chin rubbing, this might have been the most i've learned in any class.  interesting stuff too.",James Nichols ,Government department,Mandatory,
 CIV10,4.5,2.0,,,,,Unbelievable professor. Makes class a lot of fun and is an interesting professor. Not too bad looking either-and he likes the Dodgers,James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10,3.5,3.0,,,,,Very goofy guy. During discussions he would stop for 2 SECONDS to see if we had any comments and launch into his own exposition. In retrospect the class was pretty easy and I got exactly what I thought I would get from Civ 10. Just enough.,James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10,1.0,4.0,,,,,"This guy may be smart but he's a loony-tune. Talks endlessly, never listens to a word edgewise, and acts out every nervous compulsive twitch in class while he's rambling.  Drove me right out of the room.",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 CIV10GOV,4.0,3.0,,,,,"I took two classes from him.  I did much better in the second one.  He talks on and on, the readings are dull, but the discussion is hot.  Don't be afraid to speak your mind and engage him.  He is one of the smartest profs. we've got.",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 GOV80,4.0,4.0,,,,,"gotta do the reading in this class and nichols is a talking head but he knows his stuff.  overall i got an A- and i think i aced the final cause i went back and made sure i read the sparknotes for each book, tho i read the real texts too",James Nichols ,Government department,,
 GOV166,4.5,3.0,,,,,Great Guy...somewhat goofy.  Really knows his stuff.  Also definitely the guy to take for Gov 80.,James Nichols ,Government department,,
 GOV20,3.5,2.0,,,,,Nice guy.  Understands and works with students.  Seems to like talking more than leading discussions.  Work load very reasonable.,James Nichols ,Government department,,
 RLST118,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Humes is really knowledgeable, but her lectures aren't very clear and she often gets sidetracked. However, she's very willing to work with you outside of class. She allows little time for written exams, but she's flexible with deadlines if you just ask, and tries to thoroughly prepare students for such assignments, quizzes or research papers.",Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department,Mandatory,
 RLST010,4.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Awesome lady who's very knowledgeable about the subject matter, but expects a lot of her students. As someone who took this course to fulfill a GE, I was disappointed by the amount of time it required. If you're genuinely interested in Religious Studies, you'll have a blast! If not, get ready to slog through a LOT of reading & detailed note-taking.",Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department,Mandatory,
 RLST010,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Cynthia Humes is a brilliant woman but not the best teacher in the world. I have so much respect for her as a person, but her class was a struggle. ",Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department,,
 RLST010,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,Her lectures are extremely confusing and her tests are extremely long and she does not give enough time to write too many essay questions in too little time.,Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department,,
 FHS01,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Took her freshman class.  Very interesting. papers were the only grade and shes a fairly good grader.  I would take her if you have the chance.  work load is reasonable,Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department,,
 PHIL161,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Hard class, but I loved this class, real interesting. Prof Humes really cares about her students, even cooked great Indian food for us!! Only probem is she doesn't teach that often, and only teaches the same class when she does.",Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department,,
 PHIL161,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Really smart, very helpful. Loved the class!!!",Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department,,
 RLST161,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Teaches an interesting course. Very knowledgeable, yet somewhat condescending. Erratic instructions and expectations. At times very friendly and others moody and snippy. If course material was not interesting her rating would be in the dumps.",Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department,,
 RELIGIOUS,4.5,1.0,,,,,"Most students really like her.  She acts like she's ""one of the gang"".",Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department,,
 ECON50,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,"If you fall behind it's almost impossible to catch up. He's a nice guy, but he's a bit difficult to understand during lectures. Expect to do a lot of work on your own out of the textbook to get the concepts down and use his lectures to supplement AFTER you've already looked at the lesson. Not a horrid grader, but the policy was unclear & stressful.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,1.0,Yes,,,No,Wright is right  :),Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Wright has a ""cult following"" status among CMCers. They have good reason for this -  he is a hidden gem of CMC. Despite his reputation, he's a great talker. Even though his teaching style and tests might make the class difficult, Wright is helpful in office hours & is willing to give out good grades despite a hard, but hilarious, class.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,No,"I heard people suggest me not to take his class but it turns out to be the BEST class I had in CMC. It's totally Ok if you don't understand stuff in class, just go to the office hour. He can't be more helpful and caring. He gives me wise life advices and makes me think deeper in econ. If you are really in to econ, take him!",Colin Wright ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Wright is a good bad even though he has a bad reputation. Class could be hard if you do not pay attention to his lectures. Despite that, overall it is a good class!",Colin Wright ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.0,2.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Everyone gives Professor Wright a bad rap on campus. When I signed up for his course so many people warned me against it; however, I enjoyed his course. If you pay attention in class and take his notes, you have all the information that he will test you on. Plus, he is more than willing to help anyone out during office hours.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,Niceset professor ever! Really helpful!,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Many says that he is hard and bad. I agree that he is not easy, but he is a really good professor. He knows what he is talking about. When you actually reflect on what he taught, you can apply many of them to real life. Not a lot of professors teach something flexible to use.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"He is pretty good, very helpful! He is a very good person! ",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,1.0,4.0,Yes,,C-,No,You should not take this class! This is the worst econ professor I have ever had!,Colin Wright ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,3.0,3.0,,,,No,"Despite what people say about him, Professor Wright is actually a pretty good professor.  If you pay attention during lectures and actually try and comprehend what he is saying, it's not that bad.  Yes he is more math-based than others, but he is very helpful during office hours.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 FHS10,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Absolutely amazing class. Love the discussions and Professor Wright has his unbiased views which make a lot of the discussions interesting. TAKE THIS CLASS.  He has been given a bad reputation in the Econ Dept. but this class is awesome and the course material is pretty interesting. TAKE IT!,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"He is great- doesn't assign too much work, but demands your full attention in class, which if you give him, will help a lot with tests. Plus his deviations and anecdotes during class are good times to catch up on the content and polish your notes. Very logical, no fluff, no spoon feeding, and a great professor!",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 101,4.0,3.0,,,,No,"Wright get's a really bad rep in the econ department. Personality wise, he is actually quite funny. The work load is quite easy, we only had two homeworks. All you have to do is study his modules, yes you have to know how to take the first derivative. But I found the use of math makes solving/understanding this class easier.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.0,5.0,,,,No,I thought Professor Wright's Econ 50 class was terrible for several reasons: 1) He is too math based. There were more equations than concepts. 2) Exams were hard to study for and questions were random 3) He taught the class assuming we had already taken Econ before in high school even though it's an intro course. DON'T TAKE WRIGHT!!,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.5,4.0,,,,No,if you're not good at mnath dont take this class,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,3.0,3.0,,,,No,"Prof. Wright is a great professor and I learned a lot about micro from him. Being a Mudder, no one else in my class knew any real math so they thought it was hard, but the numerical approach to problems was realistic and easier for me to understand.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,Worst professor I have ever had. All he did was talk about how we didn't know enough math. He doesn't use the textbook hardly at all and his tests come out of nowhere. Plus he's hostile at his office hours. I regret taking the class 100%. Take Bjerk instead...,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,4.5,2.0,,,,No,"He seems really hard but once you get used to his style of teaching, you learn sooo much. At times he is unintentionally intimidating but hes a nice guy really. He really knows his stuff and teaches Econ in a way it makes us think unlike other Econ teachers who use no math and just expect you to puke out defntions on the test. Best forthe long run",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"If you take this prof you are making a huge mistake. Makes easy problems hard and hard problems impossible thru his own incompetence as a teacher. You will be dumbfounded trying to teach yourself because most of the material he makes up and you have to make sense of his scribbled notes, and he makes zero sense in class. Save yourself.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Wright is not a good teacher!  I really like econ, but he is not good at teaching it.  There is no homework that you have to turn in, but the tests are very hard.  I liked the stories he told in class, and he's kinda funny, but I would've preferred if he taught better.  I took tons of notes, I thought i understood all of it, but the tests raped me",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"Wright's micro, though harder than other micro classes around, is more fun. There's no homework, so three tests decide your grade. Tests are repititive, so it's not tough to crack them. If you want to learn, then you should definitely take this class.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"Perhaps not as bad as many people here say. There are only 3 graded assignments the whole semester. If you are unlucky enough to get him, go to class and study. Some people say if you get Wright, try again next semester, and that might be right if you aren't an econ person. Otherwise, you'll have a workless semester and a mediocre grade.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,2.5,4.0,,,,No,"Uses math exclusively to teach concepts.  I didn't put a whole lot of work in to the class, but I really studied for the last test and did well.  If you're willing to do outside work to study and are good with math, you'll do fine and learn some.  Funny, but digresses into material of 101.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"Everyday: ""This is kind of Econ101 stuff that you all won't understand, but I'm going to say it anyway...""  and he was right...we didn't understand.  I learned a lot ONLY because I went out and learned it ON MY OWN...",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,,,,,"very challenging, but dont take all of these reviews too seriously.  if you really want to learn about econ and take an interesting class, i strongly recommend it, if you are too lazy to study for 3 tests in one semester, then come on, you dont deserve to be at claremont",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,1.0,5.0,,,,,"Arrogant, Unclear and Pompus.  Makes material harder than it is, and is terrible at providing examples.  Avoid him.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 MICROECONOMICS,1.0,5.0,,,,,Without a doubt the worst prof at CMC back in 1996 and it sounds like he is still going strong...,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.5,5.0,,,C,,"he was funny in class, but unclear and the test material came out of nowhere...he is also too focused on math.  nice guy though",Colin Wright ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 101,1.0,5.0,,,,,Wright is Wrong! Avoid like the plague.,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.0,5.0,,,,,"Avoid at ALL COSTS. If he is the only one teaching the class you want, wait until later to take it. His class will ruin your GPA and leave you clueless much of the time. He's a nice and funny guy, but he is a sucky and unfair teacher.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,,"What a ridiculous professor. He is very unclear and never does any problems in class to prepare students for the midterms. Also, doesn't curve tests when the highest grade is an 81 and says his normal grade for an Econ 50 class is a B-. Avoid if possible",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.5,3.0,,,,,"He's not clear enough and the lectures are somewhat disorganized. Having said that, he does bring up some neat problems in class and you'll learn how to graph dozens of lines in one graph. But he's pretty damn boring to listen to.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.0,4.0,,,,,"Funny guy...I don't know about how nice he is, though.  Not very willing to help or explain, or teach for that matter. His class frustrated me more than any class at CMC so far.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.0,5.0,,,,,Avoid if possible,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,4.0,3.0,,,Not_Sure_Yet,,"Funniest prof I've taken. Also a genuine nice guy under his econ exterior. Only decently prepares his lectures, tends to ramble, but makes them good through poignant anecdotes. Hard subject, easy grader.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,,,,,"Good prof but difficult subject no matter who you take it with... He can be slightly intimidating, but to do do well, you just need to work hard.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.0,4.0,,,,,"Blub-blub-blub, students ten years ago cared about econ.",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.0,4.0,,,,,Don't you care about econ anymore? blub blub blub...  -Colin Wright,Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 101,1.0,5.0,,,,,"cannot teach, boring",Colin Wright ,Economics department,,
 ARTH2000,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Meyer is intensely brilliant and provokes thoughtful discussion, making tricky concepts fun to think about. Her class is deeply challenging, combining serious readings with weekly writings and asking students to critically analyze complex texts and images. You will succeed if you strive, and she'll make you want to strive. I recommend!",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 DANTE1,5.0,5.0,,,,No,"Prof Meyer is a very eccentric prof, no doubt about it. She is also very serious about lit, so if you take her class take it seriously. And if you like Dante, you must take her class. I personally was reluctant to take Dante, but she opens your eyes to his brilliance. One of the hardest and most stimulating lit classes I took at CMC.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"Before I took the class I thought that Meyer's ratings were tough. They are not. Professor Meyer does not care about her lit 10 classes and she does not prepare for them. She is not that hard, but she assigns grades quite randomly.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 DANTE112,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"She's a little batty (replied to a request to meet outside office hours with ""Your second paper topic looks great.""), but you come to love her. She leads the most intellectual class discussions I've ever encountered, and she doesn't overload you with pointless work. She LOVES Dante, so if you have any interest in him, take her class!",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT1,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She can be intimidating at times, but she's an excellent professor with a vibrant passion for literature.  She's very open to student ideas and encourages expression at every opportunity.  You must do all the reading and attend every class in order to succeed, but you'll find that you enjoy it and you will learn a great deal.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LITSECT,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"I'm not a lit major but I've taken several lit courses bc of Meyer.  Despite what other negative comments there might be, give her a chance.  She doesn't demand much of you and she usually only assigns short essays.  She gets incredibly excited about the topics and (if you try some) you'll get excited too.  She's brilliant and awesome!",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 DANTE,4.5,3.0,,,,,"I love my experience with Meyer. She does not hold your hand in class, spoon feeding you information like you're a baby bird but leads class discussions forcing us to think about the text in new ways. She requires her students to respect the educational experience in her class, which is too much for some.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,4.0,3.0,,,,,Very passionate and knowledgable.,Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT20,2.0,3.0,,,,,"If you're interested in French feminist literature, this is the place for you.  Very harsh on guys.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT63,1.5,2.0,,,,,Seems to be very hit-or-miss. She loves butt-kissers. Do not question her statements (especially if you're right & can prove it) or she will hate you. Talk to her about the papers or she'll get grumpy. Tread lightly with her and you should be fine.,Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,1.5,3.0,,,,,"steer clear, but if you can't, dont get on her bad side",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT62,5.0,3.0,,,,,"I don't know about her bad side, but I found her to be really passionate about the subject which was refreshing.  She was nice and seemed to be willing to accept different interpretations.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,4.5,3.0,,,,,Don't get on her bad side but she's very clear as to what is and isn't acceptable.  If you participate in class then you are golden.,Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT63,2.0,3.0,,,,,"DO NOT GET ON HER BAD SIDE.
 again: 
 DO NOT GET ON HER BAD SIDE.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,1.0,3.0,,,,,"She refused to teach, instead making us lead our own class discussions (but interrupting frequently, of course, to tell us we were wrong.)  Better hope you agree with her viewpoints.  Also, if you're a guy, try and stear clear - MANHATER",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,3.5,2.0,,,,,"My mom liked her.  I guess that's the only nice thing I have to say, about her.  She almost hit me with her car!  And I was a pedestrian... live in fear, people",Ann Meyer ,Literature department,,

 FHS010,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Would not recommend taking him for fhs or even govt. A lot of people said hes easy but hes not. Hes become a very hard grader. What was most annoying was that we never got any guidelines on papers. He told us to write about anything and gave no structure. Also he has a very weird grading system in which he uses points. very boring class.,Jay Martin ,Government department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A+,No,"Get ready to write a one-page essay every week exploring one of the various different humanities subjects you will be exposed to in this class. Jay Martin is a really sweet and kind professor, and he has some cool perspectives and really bad-ass life experiences to share. Fun guy to get to know! (Also, take him if you want an easy-A FHS class.)",Jay Martin ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV20,3.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Boring lectures WHO SAID THIS CLASS WAS EASY? lots of readings. daily quizzes.   but he's a nice person,Jay Martin ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV20,4.5,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Pretty manageable intro gov class, lots of reading and daily quizzes, but no big tests or long essays, only 1 page papers. Participate and show you care",Jay Martin ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV20,4.0,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"Very nice man. Writes amazing recommendations, so get to know him. Intro level gov class- His lectures could be boring at times, but hes clearly interested in the subject matter.  Participate for the debates and do the readings for the daily quizzes. An A is not impossible.",Jay Martin ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV020,4.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Awesome guy.  Old, tenured, but still clearly has a passion for education and learning.  Not in that he loves helping students but that he loves talking about his subject matter.  Lectures are boring and just a review of the reading, but he drops in nuggets about his life (was a spy).  CLASS IS GRADED ON A CURVE so 30% get As, 50% Bs, 20% Cs.",Jay Martin ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV20,3.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,Really nice and interesting person. I recommend you go to lunch with him when he offers. There's a good amount of reading in the beginning but it gets easier. Had daily quizzes and then daily debates. We read a lot of supreme court cases.,Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 FHS,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Martin is a very sweet man who knows a lot about different subjects, but he tends to ramble on during class discussions. Gives multiple one page papers plus a final paper of 12+ pages. Subject material (ballet and opera) is great. Easy class overall, but not very invigorating or interesting during class lectures.",Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 FHS010,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"FHS:Opera/Ballet.Signed up for it simply for the sake of trying something new.Now,I love the genres.I attribute my new-found appreciation and growth simply with respect to  lit. to Dr. Martin.1 1-page essay/wk.20pg final paper.no midterms.He practices psych, is a gov. prof,knows 7 languages,and was a Buddhist Monk.kind man;relaxed class;good books",Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 GOV20,4.0,1.0,,,,No,Super laid-back gov 20 class. Took as a GE because I had no interest in the subject at all. Only downside was daily quizzes but definitely better than having huge exams to study for. Very easy class and good discussions in class.,Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 GOV20,3.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"I was someone that took gov in high school and had no interest in taking gov 20. if you are this person- jay martin is for you. he is the easiest prof i have ever had, yet he makes the class interesting for people that know a little about gov coming in. no hw, no papers, no final- just fill in the blank tests. easiest A ever",Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 GOV20,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"good teacher, a little spacey, wants everyone to do well",Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 GOV180E,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Interesting prof with so many amazing stories!,Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 GOV20,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Professor Martin is awesome.  I had virtually no interest in taking Gov 20 but it ended up being one of my favorite classes at CMC thanks to him.  The second half of the class was devoted to Supreme Court cases which was really interesting.  He is always available for help and give you his home phone number in case you need it.,Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 CIV10,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Jay Martin was brought to CMC to create the CIV program, thus...it's natural that he's really good at teaching it.  You look at a lot of classic texts (I had read almost all of them  in HS). One page reaction paper due with each text.  Lots of interesting class discussion.  Has a super interesting life.  Very particular about Strunk & White.",Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 GOV20,4.5,2.0,,,,,"Best professor I've had at CMC to date. Highly knowledgeable, helpful, a good communicator, and a very kind person. You won't get nearly as much out of the course though w/o doing most of the readings. Lectures are chill, even funny at times. Office hours are great. Take him & you'll learn alot minus the stress & garbage assignments.",Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 CIV10,3.0,3.0,,,A,,His class is fairly easy (1 page paper a week) until the end.  Then he smacks you with a 20 page final!,Jay Martin ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV20,5.0,2.0,,,,,"He's a bowl of knowledge and an interesting guy, very helpful in office hours and only one midterm and then the final, if you do the readings you'll be fine, if you don't it's not going to be fun...class gets relatively long, but he's an interesting prof!",Jay Martin ,Government department,,
 GOV20,5.0,1.0,,,,,guy is sooo smart and knows so many random facts!,Jay Martin ,Government department,,

 AST66,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I took astro for my science GE, but ended up really enjoying it! Tom is a great teacher with a fabulous sense of humor. There's no HW besides studying for the 4 exams (all MC, challenging but fair) and the material is fascinating. There are only 5 labs, which are relatively quick/easy, but you CANNOT miss any. Would definitely recommend the class!",Thomas Dershem ,Physics department,,
 ASTR066,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"Although I do think he was very nice and approachable, his lecture style was very convoluted and hard to follow. The test questions were also sometimes hard to follow/confusing.

 ASTR66,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"His lectures and his tests are accurate, I have no idea what the last reviewer was talking about. If you are an intelligent  person the tests are not that difficult at all- I got an A without trying to hard. In spite of the fact that his lectures are all powerpoint presentations, this is probably one of the most interesting classes I've ever taken.",Thomas Dershem ,Physics department,,
 AST66,1.0,5.0,,,,,"an absolute nightmare.  I took this class for fun and ended up correcting him on every detail nearly half the time.  His tests were inacurate and he expects you to do most the learning on your own.  His teaching style is designed for (dare I say?) a large state school, which is what Claremont is SO not about.",Thomas Dershem ,Physics department,,
 PHYS30LAB,4.5,4.0,,,,,Prof Dershem seriously wants you to learn-- my group was the last to leave lab every time and he still kept his patience.  Very tough to get a good grade but if you ask for help he will give it to you!  A really nice guy!,Thomas Dershem ,Physics department,,

The tests and essays are hard- I recommend talking to him in his office hours beforehand.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL30,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Davis is an excellent lecturer and a knowledgeable scholar of Philosophy.

The course work is not particularly challenging, especially if you're interested in the subject matter.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL200,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Stephen Davis is a dedicated scholar and caring teacher. He addresses his students with respect but demands their best thinking. The only bad thing I can say is that he is retiring soon. I wish I could learn more from him.,Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department,,

 PHIL30,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,lectures are so clear & comprehensive that you don't need to read; just GO TO CLASS & take good notes. not an easy grader. knows a TON. open to student opinions but not much discussion - more focus on history of phil than student discussion. good class.,Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department,,
 RLST143,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Davis is a GREAT lecturer and is always open to comments/questions, which he answers with clarity and respect.

 RLST43,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor.  Knows his stuff.  He cleans up most of the reading in his lectures and makes it understandable.

Good for a GE, and a great religion/philosophy professor.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL170,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"do NOT take this course to satisfy a GE or for an intro philosophy course. concepts are extremely hard to grasp and the reading is dense and circular. prof davis does a decent job explaining some of the material, but not all of it. he's a nice guy, though, and will help if you ask. if you're really into philosophy, this might be a class for you.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department,,

 ECON175,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Nothing but positive things to say about Prof A. She is amazing at giving feedback outside of class and will not judge you when you have the stupidest questions.

 LABOR1,1.0,3.0,,,,Yes,She sucks. She maybe has published some econ papers but when it comes to actually explaining the material she sucks. She sucks. I did fine in her class... She has 10% participation but doesnt take attendance. There is no final and no homework. This means your grade is dependent upon what he overall opinion of you is. Which is good and bad...,Heather Antecol ,Economics department,,
 ECON175,4.5,3.0,,,,No,Professor Antecol is in her element in this class. This is what she likes to research and it shows. Light work load day to day. Tests are very tricky but graded on a pretty soft curve.,Heather Antecol ,Economics department,,
 ECON175,3.5,3.0,,,,No,She's awesome. She is able to teach the material well and is reasonable in her grading and work assignments. She's a great choice for a prof.,Heather Antecol ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.5,3.0,,,,,Antecol was all about proving microeconomic theory rather than explaining its significance.  Class is almost not worth coming to because you just get lost in her quick mathematical proofs.  Problem sets are due weekly...huge pain.

 GOV149,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"He literally expects that you have ALL the time in the world to finish the work for his class-as if other classes don't exist, or thesis, or job search, or jobs.

Never take his class if you can avoid it",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 USISR1,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Haley is an awful professor who began every class with a tangent that no one could follow. The books were interesting but he can't at fostering discussion, fails to make the material accessible, and speaks for about 2/3 of the time. This class is hard--because you are constantly trying to guess the exact phrasing of exactly what he wants to hear.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOVT149,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor. Passionate about the course material, has high expectations of students but gives them tools necessary to meet expectations, helps prepare students for the real world, gives really in depth and good comments on writing, have to read and write A LOT in his class, but its worth it...not just busy work. Lectures not boring but great!",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV149,3.5,4.0,,,,No,"Any IR major should definitely go meet with Haley. He's a great advisor and will really take care of you if you get to know him. He's getting senile, so he rambles a lot in class, but if you go to office hours a bunch you can do fine in the class.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOVT70,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"This is probably the most reading I have ever done in my life.  This class will really expand your horizons, and Haley will invest a LOT in interested students... but you need to REALLY WORK HARD for his approval - he gets to be like your dad, taking all your successes and failures very personally.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV70,4.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"My favorite class. Haley demands a lot, but he is worth it because you will really learn how to present and defend an argument under the kind of scrutiny you would receive out in the real world, where answers must be clear, precise, and short. Highly recommend. I got an A in his class and I consider it my biggest college achievement.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOVT149,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Very knowledgeable and extremely kind, but better as a mentor than a professor.  He's forgetful, picky, and kinda random.  Assigns TONS of reading and papers and grades very hard, you have to do *exactly* what he's looking for.  He'll read drafts of papers, which is helpful.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV70,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"a good man, and clearly brilliant, but its  apparent that he is no longer fit to teach. forgetful when it comes to details as to what you have done; the writing process with him is infuriating; his goal teaching writing is to create intellectual clones of himself. his comments are incomprehensible, and meeting him for feedback is equally as useless",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV70,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Expects a lot of his students. Do the reading, if you don't and try to BS an answer during class he will call you out. Very much discussion based. Extremely helpful during office hours. He made me change my major to IR and is now my adviser.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOVT70,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"This class requires an outrageous amount of work.  This class was more work than my other 4 combined.  A 10 and 14 page midterm assigned Thursday and due Tuesday?!

I ask him a question about the final paper, base my entire paper on it, then he tells me 1 day before it's due that he wants something else!",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV151,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"U.S. Israel and Arabs is definitely worthwhile if you are interested. Otherwise, it would be painful. 3 10 page papers, weekend simulation, and you have to occasionally lead class. Haley knows a lot, but it can be tedious if people just read from notes for their presentations. Paper grading is fair, just if you know what he wants.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV150,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"US, Israel and the Arabs: You learn a lot in this class, have to work very hard. He is not terribly organized and wanders, but is very knowledgeable. Work tends to pile up. The simulation is a lot of fun, but takes a lot of time and effort. He is a hard grader on papers.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV70,3.5,3.0,,,,No,There is no way Haley earned the reputation he has now by teaching this way. I really like him as a person but every day he shows up to class and talks about whatever he feels like talking about that day.  Its a waste of time to even sit through his lectures I would only recommend him for help outside of class,Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV70,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very occasionally, you'll see flashes of brilliance.  The rest of the time, it's clear he's begun a downward spiral.  His lectures are abysmal.  Most of the time, he merely rants about Iraq, or some other hot-button issue.  The assignments are insultingly childish.  The only redeeming factor is his book selection, which was sporadically rewarding.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 LEADIPISARB,5.0,4.0,,,,,"Haley classes are tough, he demands a lot from his students.  However, his classes are quite rewarding and they are at a level advanced courses should be tought at.

 ,4.0,5.0,,,,,,Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 USISRAELARABS,2.0,4.0,,,,,"His grading was absurd. He didn't get papers back to us for a long time and the simulation, while fun, didn't count for any of our grade. He wasn't even there for most of it. He's very particular for presentation and will make you start over if its not the way he wants it. You learn a lot, but you have to put up with his ****.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV151,3.0,5.0,,,,,"i think he's senile or just lost it. your final grade has nothing to do with the class. it's amazing how he even comes up with these numbers. you learn a lot in the class, which is great and simulation is fun. however, it's really not worth the absurd ending.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,

So knowledgeable and really cares about the topic. Sort of senile, assigned a surprise 20-page paper once, but then gave no final. Listen and learn, he's so great!",Edward Haley ,Government department,,
 GOV151,3.5,4.0,,,,,"He's on the hard side, lots of reading, but the class was really interesting.  His lectures are painful, but thats why he tends not to lecture and lets students do the teaching.  I learned alot.  Haley's a good guy.",Edward Haley ,Government department,,

 MATH030,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Do not take calculus with this professor. DO NOT. Especially if you are new to the subject and think you will need help. He is cold, unapproachable, and often gives you a hard time for asking a questions as if you are dumb. When he does answer questions its not in a clear, understandable way. Worst professor I have had for a small college",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH111,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,No,"He is the worse professor I've ever met in CMC. Unclear in class lectures. Unhelpful homework, especially mean to student during office hours. If there is an alternative to his DifQ, take the other ones.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH30,3.0,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"It would definitely help to have some background in Calc before taking this class as he breezes over some of the important concepts, but overall it was an easy class. He gives trial quizzes that are identical to the real quiz, and will tell you all the possible questions he could ask beforehand. He also gives you 2 free pts on each quiz. Take him!!",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH030,1.5,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,He is a very intelligent person but does not know how to lecture. He was hard to follow and then was mean to students who asked questions. I took high school Calculus AB and still found it hard to understand him some times. The homework is not mandatory but it will help you understand the lectures more if you keep up with the homework.,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH111,3.5,4.0,Yes,,B+,No,"Tells you exactly what to expect on day 1. The class seems easy because he types up notes for you to minimize work on your end, but the tests are pretty hard. A lot of work but if you stay current you should do fine. Lectures aren't very engaging, but they're only 50 minutes long. Good prof for differential equations",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH030,3.5,1.0,Yes,,A,No,Knowledgeable professor who wrote the textbook we use. Every class was lecture with no participation required. Sometime he blocks the board but he always hands out notes before class with everything you need to learn. Gives out practice tests one week prior to exams that are almost identical to the actual tests. HW was optional,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 CALC30,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Not much to say. Gives prequizzes, helps those who need it although be it reluctantly as he expects you to immediately grasp the concepts. Still, he is not a mean teacher and he is quite funny if you like his humor. Helpful, Easy, take him.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH30,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,This class was amazing! I really would take my next calc with this professor if he would teach one. He always gives prequizes and its pretty easy to prepare for them.,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,He's not very nice but tries to help in his office hours and over email or even on the phone. Super lenient on grades. Gives a ton of make-up opportunities. And it's quite true that he doesn't really cares about the students b/c he says a lot that he knows the majority of ppl in the class only take it to fulfill GE.,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC1,4.5,1.0,,,,No,Didn't crack open the textbook. Make sure you take notes during his lectures and listen to his tips. He gives a practice quiz for everything and just changes the numbers around so review that. Easy A. Doesn't need much time. No need to go to office hours. Good if you memorize patterns. Realizes he blocks the board and types out notes for you.,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH111,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"Pretty easy if you read the notes and make an effort to understand them. He wants students to understand the material and do well, so the class is both helpful and easy. He also offers shortcuts where they exist without beating around the bush, which is great.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,3.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Very easy class. Homework not mandatory, notecard given on tests. However, Bradley's lectures are extremely dull and he moves pretty fast. Boring class, easy A.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC1,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"easy class. assigns HW and never checks it. lets you use a notecard on tests and gives practice tests that are 90% identical to the actual exam. extremely boring as a teacher. if you dont mind studying the material yourself, and going to office hours for additional help, you will A+ this class. super nice professor. recommend this class highly!",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH32,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,This professor gets a bad rep of being boring and difficult. From my experience he was not the most interesting professor but he was nice and very fair with grading. He is always in his office to help you and lets you use a note card on all tests. He is great. Easy and taught me the material.,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH32,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"this is my review for calc iii. first things first, you get to use a notecard on all the quizzes. second, there is a take home worth lots of points = easy A IF you spend the time. third, the final is designed to bring your grade UP UP UP. overall, if you put in the time and understand everything, you and your notecard will rock this class, the end.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH032,3.0,3.0,,,,No,"Reasonably good teacher if you pay attention, but he doesn't make the lectures very interesting, so that can be hard. Grades are based off of in-class quizzes and one take-home test, which can be problematic if you tend to make mistakes on tests. Then again, regular homework doesn't need to be turned in, so you can get away with not doing it.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH111,1.0,2.0,,,,No,"If you are good at plugging things into a calculator and memorizing things, this is the class for you!

The guy lists ""Linear Algebra using Graphing Calculators"" as a Research Interest. That should say it all...",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC2,2.0,3.0,,,,No,Very boring and monotonous. no homework. 5 quizzes a take home test and a final. tests are hard but he lets you use a flash card for all quizzes and a sheet of paper for the test. overall the class was still hard but not impossible,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Absolutely awful professor.  If you don't know the material going in, he's not going to teach it to you.  Class is not worth going to, you might as well sit in your dorm and read the book (which he wrote and simply transcribes onto the board).  On tests you get a note card, which insures you learn nothing. Take someone else.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,

 MATH30,4.0,2.0,,,,No,"very realistic. you aren't required to do homework, but he gives you extra problems if you them. tests and quizzes are very straight-forward and he allows a note card. he doesn't try to trick you. just study the practice quizzes and you'll be fine.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC30,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"i think he is more suited to teaching higher level math. he can be very confusing at times, and if you ask questions that he considers dumb then he can be very condescending. but it's really cool that he lets you use a note sheet on every test and quiz and gives you a solutions packet beforehand.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"doesnt seem to care much wether you learn or not. let's notesheets on midterms and finals. if you ask a lot of questions, especially stupid ones, he'll probably make fun of you and refuse to answer it. secret to a decent grade is writing down his whole practice test on your notesheet, he only changes the numbers around, but keeps it mostly the same",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,

 MATH32,5.0,3.0,,,,,"I thought he was a great professor.

Highly recommended.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department,,
 LINEARALGEBRA,3.5,2.0,,,,,"He can be condescending, not answering questions or making you feel stupid if you just want him to slow down, and he stands in front of what he's written so you can't read what he wrote.

 ECON50,4.5,5.0,,,,No,"material was straightforward and easy, tests were very tricky and difficult, prof w enjoys throwing curveballs and phrasing test questions poorly to throw off students, tests are worth 85% of your grade and since he likes to be tricky and no straightforward on tests, the course can be quite difficult",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,4.5,2.0,,,,No,Really straightforward material that is easy to grasp if you have any mathematical ability.

 ECN50,5.0,3.0,,,,No,Great Teacher.  At first i was having alot of trouble understanding the concepts but his graphs and explanations behind them made it more clear for me.  He really takes time out of his schedule to help students.  If youre a visual learner he's definitely the teacher for you!  Hes also just a really nice guy in general.  I recommend taking him.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,
 MACRO,3.5,3.0,,,,,"He's kind of odd, and tells the same jokes over again, but I found the class interesting. The most important thing is to memorize the graphs and make sure to understand them.",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,5.0,3.0,,,,,very clear and incredibly funny.  i would recommend him if you want a straightforward econ 50 experience.  i also think he's a pretty nice guy.  just follow his system and you'll be fine.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.5,4.0,,,,,"def a dork, hard tests, does not grade easy, doesn't clarify the answer when you ask a question, will not help out when you have trouble, or had trouble, with a concept. make sure you label ALL CHARTS!!! marks off random point values.",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,4.5,4.0,,,,,"Made classes interesting.  The jokes showed that he didn't mind being looked at funnily.  The best thing was he had a core set of stuff he wanted you to take out of the class, so he emphasized that.  I feel like I know the basics now.  Hard tests.",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,3.0,4.0,,,,,hez got the lamest jokes..he goes over the simple stuff over and over again and the hard stuff he quickly goes over..his tests..arent..easy..,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,4.5,3.0,,,,,Great prof for Econ 50.  His lectures and reveiw sessions really help.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,1.0,3.0,,,,,He sucks.... He doesn't know the stuff and his exam is vague.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,3.5,2.0,,,,,If you have to take econ 50 Weidenmier is probably easier than most of the other profs.  He gives you printouts of his power point lectures and practice tests for the midterms and final.  He also tries to be funny too.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department,,

 ID109,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"One of my favorite music courses.  Gratz is really a nice guy, and a wonderful musician. If you don't go to his concerts and you don't participate in class, you will not do well. He is a fair grader and it is possible to get an A if you do the work. And his class is interesting.",Reed Gratz ,History department,,
 ID109,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I took this class thinking it would be easy, but anyone who says it is easy is CRAZY. His tests are difficult they made me want to cry--which is ironic, because music is supposed to be fun. But he is into small details and I just could not follow him. Not too many papers/tests, but grades very harshly.",Reed Gratz ,History department,,
 HISTJAZZ,3.0,1.0,,,,,Loves to teach and can be engaging because of it. But his class is poorly organized. Very easy. Lots of films of live performances. Mandatory attendance at 3 jazz concerts. Papers are generally reaction papers.,Reed Gratz ,History department,,
 FIN450,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"It's a class of mostly seniors so she's pretty chill about assigned work and grading.

The lectures are pretty long and arduous.",Janet Smith ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 FIN450,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Janet Smith is one of the finest professors at CMC. She throws the kitchen sink at you in terms of resources (textbook, PowerPoints, practice problems & solutions) that enable you succeed in her course. Her lectures are very focused. She is an extremely pleasant person and I learned a great deal about valuation of new ventures in her course.",Janet Smith ,Economics department,,
 ECON164,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"This class is very helpful- but as usual, I've found econ to be common sense+quant skills.  Smith helps you apply both.  She is not the most profound, but she is very clear.",Janet Smith ,Economics department,,

 EN01,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Bilger was one of my favorite instructors while I was an undergraduate, and now that I'm in grad school, I appreciate her even more.

 LIT166,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Bilger is amazing! She's a really nice person and eager to help you if you don't understand. Taking feminist theory with her was definitely a good choice. The class was mostly discussion about the text you had to read for homework, which may have gotten boring sometimes. You can ask her to help edit your essays too!",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,
 LIT68,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof Bilger is funny, nice and interesting. Lots of reading, but what do you expect in a lit class? Really uses class discussions well; our class on theater did performances too, which were fun. She knows her field well, and she gives you lots of freedom and feedback on papers. Definitely worthwhile, especially if you like seminar classes.",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,
 LIT101,4.0,4.0,,,,No,Audrey's passion for Literature definitely comes across in her teaching,Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,
 LITSECT,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"One of my those life changing professors.

 LIT000,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,I took Feminist Theory from Prof. Bilger sort of because I felt like it was something I ought to do before graduating from Scripps.  It ended up completely changing the way I view the world.  It was empowering in the most amazing way.  The material is great and Bilger lets the students take control of class discussions.,Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,
 WOMENINCOMEDY,5.0,3.0,,,,,"A fantastic class with a great reading list and engaging discussions.  Professor Bilger is knowledgeable, supportive, and accessible.  First class I've had where student led discussions have been fun and effective.  Very helpful during office hours.",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,

 LIT10,2.0,3.0,,,,,"This was a bad class. Prof. is very defensive and at times hostile, rejecting students ideas that don't line up w/ her own narrow, feminist, anti-male perspective. Grading policies are subjective and unfair. Don't touch w/ a ten-foot pole. (I want a refund.)",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,
 LIT010,1.5,3.0,,,,,Terrible teacher.  Teacher lets feminist ideologies get in the way of teaching.  She plays favorites and will not allow contradictions to her own ideas.  She will actually grade people down for stating contradicting opinions during class.  She's an easy te,Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,
 FEMINISTTHEORY,5.0,4.0,,,,,"She has one of the largest cult followings at CMC. She's a hard grader. Her office hours are jampacked.  That said, she's incredibly, incredibly nice and down to earth. Go chat with her just for fun (if there's not a huge line).",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,

 LIT10,5.0,4.0,,,,,"She's awesome!  She definitely keeps each student accountable for the reading.  Each student has to post in an online discussion on WebCT before each class.  At first I found this really annoying, but it keeps everyone reading.  This makes for some great discussions.  I highly recommend her class!!!",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,4.5,3.0,,,,,"This has been my best and favorite reading based class I've taken at CMC.

 MATH30,1.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"He is a very bad teacher, but the class was easy (that might be because i took it in highschool).

 CSCI51,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Do not take this course.  If you must take CSCI 51, take it at Pomona or with Professor Lee.  Pinter-Lucke should not be teaching this course.

 MATH31,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"The material covered in the class was pretty easy, I understood it, but the grades are not a good indication of this.

Helpful during office hours.",Mary Hatcher-Skeers ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM14,5.0,5.0,,,Rather_Not_Say,Yes,Very good at explaining the material and makes sure you get it. Classes are very fast (rushes through topics) and very packed with material (covers a lot of topics in one class).

 CHEM040,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Great Teacher and Extremely helpful! she explains well , but lectures are extremely fast and very ""dense"" (material wise). she will cover a chapter per lesson and usually expects you to ""fill in the blanks"" ( what you didnt understand in class) by solving problems from the textbook. and a lot. thats how she expects you to get the material ""down"".",Mary Hatcher-Skeers ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM14L,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Love her! Her tests are very hard because of time constraints but her lectures are crystal clear. Might seem intimidating at first but is such a wonderful person and teacher.

 FHS10,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Rosenbaum's FHS class is about the intersection of eastern and western history and philosophy.

 HIST163,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Rosenbaum has fine-tuned this class over many decades. He enjoys discussions with his students, both inside and outside the classroom.

 HIST163,2.5,2.0,,,,No,"Modern Chinese History could've been a great course, but Rosenbaum was just so boring and, above all, disorganized. He rambled on and on without really saying anything, and he strayed off the syllabus for weeks without being aware of it. Nice guy, and obviously knowledgeable. Perhaps his teaching skills declined as he aged, which is too bad.",Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department,,
 HIST164,1.0,2.0,,,,Yes,The worst teacher I've had at this school. Lectures go absolutely nowhere and use of Powerpoint is almost redundant. I guess he is willing to help outside of class but his classes are boring and a huge waste of time.

 MODERCHIN,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Rosenbaum is such a great guy! His lectures can be a bit boring at times and he does assign a lot of reading, but you learn tons and still really enjoy the class.

The overall class isn't amazing, but I would take him again.",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,3.0,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Lectures are boring, and can be skipped. He puts in the effort to learn his students' names. Very nice, smart professor. 5 quizzes throughout the semester  too many.",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON150,2.5,3.0,,,,No,"Didn't like his teaching style. Really liked the 5 quiz system. Didn't like the online portion of the class. Professor Rosett has an odd sense of humor that can be really amusing, but is also easily distracted from the course material. Most of the learning is self-study",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department,,

 ECON86,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"if professor Massoud didnt have such a great reputation, rosett would be regarded as one of the best professors in the department. hes an amazing guy- he likes to challenge his students, but that just makes you perform at a level you never could have expected of yourself. amazing man.",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"A good teacher. Better than average. Also very friendly. His corny jokes really helps me get through 3 hours/week of numbers and words. He teaches most things clearly, but if anything is confusing, he doesn't clarify any better, even if you ask him during office hrs. Tests strongly based on class notes-not too bad. Accting is sometimes interesting.",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department,,
 ECON150,4.5,4.0,,,,,Professor Rosett is very funny.  He does his best to enertain in a class like accounting which generally isnt very enertaining.  The quizzes are really tough unless you are committed to learning the details that are covered in the book.  The accounting concepts are not difficult and they are important for upper level accounting classes.,Joshua Rosett ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,2.5,4.0,,,,,"Rossetts conveniently posts everything from the homework to your letter grade over the net.  His tests are tricky and he gives 70 MC, which is torture but overall he is a ""nice"" teacher with sloppy handwriting.

 CALC2,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I always was one of those kids who ""just doesn't get math."" Prof Peterson changed that.

Her feedback and guidance during freshman year were invaluable in my later finance courses. If you put in the work she is a great resource.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC30,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"The worst teacher I have ever encountered. Homework was rarely covered in class and tests were tough. If you have never taken calculus before, avoid at all possible costs.

 MATH30,1.0,3.0,,,,Yes,do not take this class. this women is possibly the worst teacher i have ever encountered.  calc and math in general will be ruined for you. it will be the worst part of your week. some kids never come to class except for the tests class is so unbearable. stay away.,Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC50,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,This woman will make you hate math. Avoid at all costs.,Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,The class is easier if you've already had calc before. Watch out for tough tests and some crazy problems in homework assignments that aren't covered in class. The final is basically bits and pieces of each previous test so if you study you should be okay.,Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,1.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Stay away whatever you do. She will torment you with terrible explanations and homework that is so much harder than any of the tests. If you're lucky, you'll get another teacher",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Terrible Prof. She will make you hate math. Her problem is she relies way too much on the text for her explanations and makes everything more complicated than it has to be. Don't take her for intro courses,Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC030,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"she was quirky, and somewhat entertaining, but took a subject that I'm normally good at and between her and the book, made it much more difficult than it actually is.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,

 MATH030,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"While she may be helpful and willing to answer questions, she wouldn't have to if she explained the material fully before assinging homework.

In my opinion, an awful prof.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,

 MATH030,1.0,4.0,,,,,"Easily the worst teacher - in the world.  Absurd and completely unhelpful homework assigned every class period, expected to take 2 hours.

She's pretty nice too.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,3.0,3.0,,,,,"If you've taken calc before or math is your strength, it's easy to do well. Frankly there isn't much choice in calc teachers at CMC and it seems she's the best you can do.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC30,2.0,2.0,,,,,"You better have taken Calc before, because this lady  cannot teach. She's nice, but very very very nerdy and boring and confusing.

 MATH031,4.5,2.0,,,,,"She has a great sense of humor and likes to enertain the class.  She throws around a lot of weird/random math jokes, but does a good job getting the material across.

 CALC31,5.0,2.0,,,,,"Compared to most other professors, Peterson is paradise! She actually explains the material in class and is always open to questions.

Also very good in office hours.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department,,

 BIO44,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Preest is a nightmare.I had her for lab/class. She will ruin any interest you have in biology. I took Bio,considering it as a major, but after her class, I will be switching. She is inconsiderate and doesn't care about her students. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS/LAB WITH HER! It is not unusual to get a D on a lab report without any comments. Beware!",Marion Preest ,Biology department,,
 BIO132L,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Preest is not bubbly, but she is extremely caring. Expectations are high but extremely clear. Labs are fun (you get to play with a lot of animals) but to succeed on lab reports you must spend a lot of time meeting with her for guidance (and if, god forbid, you hurt an animal, you should probably run and never come back). Highly recommended class!",Marion Preest ,Biology department,,
 BIO44,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Her tests are based on memorization rather than understanding of the material. Thus makes it hard for certain people. Will judge you based on whether or not you sit in the front or the back of class and if you bring your laptop or not. Very useful during office hours. Somewhat intimidating though.,Marion Preest ,Biology department,,
 BIOL44,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Lectures are really clear. Hard to raise your grade especially if you're not a great test-taker.,Marion Preest ,Biology department,,
 INTROBIO,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Preest expects you to know what she has taught you, and to know it well, but not at all to a ridiculous degree.  She truly engages in the material, and gets her students to as well.  I appreciate her side stories and examples of concepts she's talking about.  Wonderful!",Marion Preest ,Biology department,,
 BIOL132L,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Grades labs very hard (I don't think anyone ever got an A on a lab report). Lab will definitely bring down your grade, but on plus side, you get to play with toads. Lecture is very easy. Don't even read the book. Just study her lecture slides. Generally nice and approachable, but can be mean/moody at times. Yelled at me for being late to lab once.",Marion Preest ,Biology department,,

 BIO43L,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"She focuses only on ""feature investigations"" which are hard to understand because she doesn't teach the basic material well at all.

 BIO43L,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"She's pretty terrible. Assigned at least 50 pages of reading in the textbook each week. Doesn't curve her tests, even though everyone failed the second one.

 BIO43,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"really don't like her. she spends way too much time lecturing on the ""feature investigations"" from the book and doesn't even come close to covering the material in class that she should.  nice in person, but bad in lecture. her tests are too long and pretty hard. take someone else if you can for bio43, but she's probably good for upper level stuff.",Gretchen Edwalds-Gilbert ,Biology department,,

 AISS1,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Nice and very friendly, cute overall. Pretty bad lecturer; she just posts pictures from the book and jumps around randomly to new subjects. Her assignments and tests are pretty pointless, but she'll count almost anything right if you BS a little. If you put in a little work the class is pretty easy, but you really have to teach yourself.",Gretchen Edwalds-Gilbert ,Biology department,,
 AISS001,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Not the best lecturer but really helpful and painfully nice and funny.

 BIO43,2.0,4.0,,,,,"Honestly, I felt attending class was a waste of time.  She would only put up overhead pictures from the chapter, and never reviewed the concepts from the text.

 GOV125,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Extremely kind, very invested in student learning and well-being! The class is almost entirely discussion based, but Professor Spalding steps in when necessary.

 GOVT125,2.0,5.0,,,,No,"I heard current students complain, so here are my thoughts from '08. The class is a waste b/c the prof doesn't actually teach.

 GOVT125,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Spalding is the only thing wrong with the D.C. program.  Her grading is subjective and arbitrary, her favorites are obvious, and, though she may seem nice in a group setting, she's a witch when she has a problem with you.  As a director, she doesn't hold to her own program rules, punishing students on a whim...and I'm a conservative male.",Elizabeth Spalding ,Government department,,
 GOV125,2.0,4.0,,,,,"Be very careful before entering the DC Program. While Spalding may be a good person, she is by no means a good teacher. Her grading scale makes no sense.

 GOV125,4.0,4.0,,,,,"Contrary to the previous reviews, Spalding actually expects you to know your****. So come to class prepared, do the reading, and be able to defend your arguments.

 GOVSEMI,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Great Professor, very funny, definitely not the type to coddle you.  The most interesting government class I have taken at CMC.  His textbook was great to read, it was like he was just talking to you personally.  Not sure why the negative ratings, everybody who went on the DC Program my year thought he was one of the best Profs they ever had.",John Haskell ,Government department,,

 GOVT126,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Contrary to a few people on here, I thought Prof. Haskell's class was the best in D.C.  He's interesting, witty, and amazingly makes the budget process somewhat enjoyable to learn.  He's a tough grader, but it's objective and consistent.  The program is tough, and so is he.  You can do well if you put the effor in.",John Haskell ,Government department,,
 GOV126,1.0,4.0,,,,,"Despite other arguments, Haskell is not a good teacher. He doesn't answer questions but instead defers them to the students without giving any answer.

I found it refreshing.",John Haskell ,Government department,,
 GOV126,1.0,5.0,,,Incomplete,,"WORST. Blabs on about nothing. Grades like an a**. Thinks he's a comedian. Makes condescending comments.

 GOV126,1.0,4.0,,,B+,,"Professor Haskell enjoys telling jokes.  He's very smart and I think he wants the students to learn.

Take this class if you want an easy grade. Yoo is very laid back. students led class discussions",David Yoo ,History department,,
 HIST330,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,I really liked Yoo's class. He planned a field visit for us to a Buddhist center. He also had former students come and talk to us about writing a dissertation and finding a job as a professor because he felt this was as important as the class material since most students were interested in teaching. Very easy to talk to and very friendly.,David Yoo ,History department,,
 HIST120,5.0,2.0,,,,,"Great classes. The class did sometimes feel like a book club meeting instead of a history class. If Yoo would take a more active role in leading the discussion, it would be an amazing class. Yoo's comments are always helpful, and he structures his assignments to make sure his students do well. I can't wait to take another class with in him.",David Yoo ,History department,,

Easily my favorite class I've taken. Cannot stress enough how amazing this dude and class are. ",Jay Conger ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH141,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"The class is GREAT, the professor so-so. His reviews all remarked how preferential he is towards males, which is tough in a participation-heavy class, and we struggled with his lack of clarity of assignments (and making 60% of our grade due the week after thesis!). That being said, the class is AMAZING, one of the very best, just be prepared!",Jay Conger ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH141,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,He is a great professor. The majority of the grade is participation so you'll need to make sure you speak up.

 MILS001,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Honestly, I think a class from Kirkland should be a requirement for Govt majors. All the information you learn is relevant, much of it you didn't know before (I didn't) even though it impacts your life in a big way, and it will continue to be relevant when you leave CMC. Many people in Govt don't know much about the military, and that's a shame.",Robert Kirkland ,History department,,
 HIST130,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Class was awesome!  I loved it. We went in depth about topics (NOT wars and stuff).. why war crimes? does army change you? recruitment?  great topics.

 HIST130,4.5,2.0,,,,,"Only one paper makes up pretty much your entire grade, so it kinda makes it hard to want to go to class, since it'll have no effect on your grade except for the little participation and weekly summaries.

 HIST130,5.0,2.0,,,,,"He is such a cool prof- he brings cookies for every class.  He brings the topic to life, brings in guest speakers, and the class is fun.  All the MilSci kids love him too.

 PSYCH030,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Professor Halpern is very intelligent--and she knows it. She is fairly condescending and isn't very sensitive if you don't understand something.

 PSYCH30,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"our class was about 40 people, so lecture style and class size was enough that she knew our names but not enough to become close with the teacher. is a good lecturer, but some lectures straight from textbook and not very engaging. she is an easy grader on projects, homework, and essay portion of test, but multiple choice is hard. watch out!",Diane Halpern ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH30,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Very professional, very smart, very good at explaining course content. It's necessary to read every page of the textbook to do well on exams.

Your grade is completely based on arbitrary textbook terms.",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department,,
 GOV20,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"After taking a few more classes at CMC, I discovered that Uhlmann is the worst teacher I've had at the 5Cs.

He does know historical facts, however, he oftern presents them in an offensive way. DO NOT take for a GE.",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department,,
 GOV20,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great teacher, knows what he's talking about because he was there. sometimes his lectures are long, he repeats the stuff he wants you to know for the tests over and over again so its easy to predict whats on the tests.

 GOV20,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"It's really cool to know he worked in gov for a long time.

 GOV20,3.5,2.0,,,,No,"prof was not very hard. lots of reading assigned but the lectures/midterm/final had nothing to do with it.  most of his lectures were the same, and that was our midterm word for word.

Personally I would take him again if given the chance",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department,,

Interesting, but hard.",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department,,

 PSYCH110,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,Gives students everything they could possibly need to get an A on the tests and gives soft deadlines for the long research paper so you can't procrastinate (super helpful).

Really nice and doesn't mind giving lots of extra help.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH109,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"He uses a textbook that is easy to comprehend, gives handouts of his powerpoints (what his class lectures are based on), and makes a book outlining everything he teaches with spaces to take notes.

 PSYCH109,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"Cook is a really nice guy and extremely willing to help. However, I would definitely NOT recommend him for Stats.

 PYSC109,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"The material is HARD in any class.  His examples and attempts to clarify concepts were very relevant.  I never really needed outside help, but I heard he wasn't as available as he might have been.  He seems a bit scattered and more like a student- he's not your typical stuffy, arrogant CMC prof.  Overall, I really liked him.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH109,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Awful. Absolutely terrible. Avoid this professor if you ever want to understand what you're supposed to learn and get a half-decent grade. Do yourself a favor.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 PSYC109,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,Very fair teacher. I ended up learning more than I thought I could. Like any good prof he expects you to put 100% into the class and not expect things to be done for you. If you're a lazy student you might find this frustrating.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 PSYC109,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"apparently much improved from last time, but has trouble understanding questions. teaches advanced topics that are not on the test (he just thinks they're important to know). do the reading if you haven't taken stats before, otherwise skim. workload is reasonable.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH110,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"I took Cook for both Stats and Research Methods and found him fair.  He was only following the standards that Stats. and Methods profs. established before him.  Seemed hard at first, but ultimately his distribution of test scores was identical to those of other profs. in these courses.  Mostly As and Bs.  They're just tough classes with ANY prof.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 STATSPSYCH109,1.0,4.0,,,,,"He made us do all our homework from the book and then he tested us only on his own weird way of doing problems (not in the book). He is very confusing, and the only way I learned anything in that class was from reading the textbook.  He makes even the simplest concept seem difficult. He is a VERY frustrating professor! Don't take him!",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 ,1.0,4.0,,,,,,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 STATS,1.0,5.0,,,,,"I normally don't like the expression ""Avoid this professor at all costs,"" but it seems pretty fitting. Unless you have some grisly murder planned if you avoid Cook, I would suggest at least giving him a few years to get comfortable teaching here and hope he improves or gets the boot and goes back to georgia.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 COGPSYCH,1.5,4.0,,,,,the worst prof i have ever had.  very unorganized in terms of due dates so everything is pushed back until the final few weeks.  everyone failed the first test b/c he refuses to tell us what he wants from us.  never take a class from him.  i hope he is not here in the future.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCHSTATS,2.0,4.0,,,,,"Agree with previous reviewer: impossible to ever know when stuff is due. He just mentions duedates in the last few minutes of class when you are already so bored from listening to him ramble the entire class. He loves his voice and he loves to be right and he loves to be in charge. Full of himself, and poorly organized class. So boring it hurts.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCHSTATS,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Boring material, fun prof. Date-less syllabus is the most frustrating thing ever, though.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department,,

 RLST37,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Grett class! Great Professor!,Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,
 RLST153,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"He has written many papers on how religion has affected the presidency of the US and because he is a foreigner from a mostly secular country, he brings an interesting perspective.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,
 RLST153,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Not my favorite professor. He did not guide discussion well, he assigned a TON of reading and writing, and did not seem responsive to his students. He is knowledgable about the topic for the most part, but I did not enjoy the class",Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,

 RLSTSECT,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Lejon is one of the best professors I have ever had. I don't know what these guys are talking about. If you go into his office hours he will love you can give you a good grade. He is also really interesting, he was a MP in Sweden and had great stories. His class was really interesting.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,

 RLST,2.0,2.0,,,,,"Prof. Lejon, while not the best professor is very nice and not a very hard grader. He is a bit unclear and doesn't hand a lot of papers back, but he is interesting.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,
 RLST153,2.0,1.0,,,,,"Prof Lejon is GREAT! his class is an easy A, and you can get away w/o doing most of the reading. he doesn't hand back papers which is annoying, but he's really, really nice & funny, a great guy. You get out of the class what  you choose to put into it.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,
 RLST153,1.5,2.0,,,,,"This class was an easy grade though I learned almost nothing. He does not teach. It is a big free-for-all with your most outspoken classmates dominating everything. Like previously stated, he does not grade assignments.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,
 RS37,1.5,3.0,,,,,"Ok this man doesn't know what day it is. All he talks about is how great Sweeden is and how much he wished US students were like they are 'back home'... please. His tests are insane he stumbles over his own words, other students correct him...need I say more? just don't take any of his classes.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,
 RELSTUD153,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Lejon unforunately could speak a bit more clearly and give better class direction to what he wants to see in written work.  While I liked the readings and some discussions, he never hands any papers back.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,
 RLST153,2.0,3.0,,,,,It seems like he doesn't understand the American education system.  He never grades assignments or gives any indication of grades.  He also does not structure the course in any discernible manner and leaves most of the teaching up to the students.  Also important: he takes his military background seriously; don't show up late.,Kjell Lejon ,Government department,,
 LIT10,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"This was a great class. Pretty easy grader. Super chill, relaxed class. But you also actually learn a lot. Great, fair marker.",Eric Puchner ,English department,,
 ENGCW2,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"Wonderful, wonderful teacher. Super supportive. So basically, a wonderful, wonderful guy. Who also happens to be lovely to look at. Let's just say I actually made an effort to wear look nice for this class.

 BIO44,2.0,1.0,,,,No,"Compared to the other Bio 44 classes, this one is by far the easiest. If you have him for lab and lecture you are set for a good grade! Make sure to use his practice exams because he uses a lot of the previous year questions.",Dan Guthrie ,Biology department,,
 BIO44L,3.0,1.0,,,,No,"Guthrie is hilarious! You should get a good grade if you come to class and listen. He often recycles questions from old exams, and usually in his review sessions emphasizes things that won't actually be on the exam. Don't bother buying the book, all of his questions will be straight from lecture. Easy and fun to be in class!",Dan Guthrie ,Biology department,,
 BIO44,3.0,1.0,,,,No,This man is hilarious. He has very dry humor and digresses all the time. He uses a lot of the same questions on tests from practice tests and previous years. Unlimited time on tests as well.,Dan Guthrie ,Biology department,,
 BIO44,4.0,2.0,,,,No,Guthrie is AMAZING!!! One should invest in this course. Although his methods are strange he is a phenomenal teacher and I would not take another professor given the chance. You learn without actually realizing it.,Dan Guthrie ,Biology department,,
 BIO62,4.5,1.0,,,,No,This class is very interesting. He gives short summaries on environmental issues that are interesting and pertain to your life! He is also very nice in office hours and answers e-mail questions right away. I recommend this prof. for non-science majors definitely. The class is interesting (short and sweet) and the labs are easy (but boring).,Dan Guthrie ,Biology department,,
 BIO62,1.0,3.0,,,,No,His grammar does not make any sense and often he gives horrible data which makes no sense to do the assigned labs from. He also does not value the opinions of women. He generally does not care about this class or making it enjoyable or useful for any of the students.,Dan Guthrie ,Biology department,,
 BIO44,5.0,1.0,,,,,"GREAT class. It is incredibly interesting for anyone who is interested at all in questions about the origins of humanity and life.  Guthrie's class is structured in a way that lets him simply tell stories about the things that interest him.  other bio44 profs will make you memorize crap - not guthrie. Great, laid back, interesting class!",Dan Guthrie ,Biology department,,
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"By far the worst professor I have ever had, not just in college but in my entire academic career. Not only is he unclear about what will be on the exams, he is misleading, saying certain topics will not be tested and then proceeding to test the class on them anyway. He is unapproachable, ridicules you when you ask questions. DO NOT take him.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,Hands down the worst professor I have had. He's extremely unclear in what he  expects from the class - making midterms and exams very hard to prepare for. Don't let his humorous persona fool you - get out while you can!,Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,,,B,Yes,I really didn't like how he belittles you when you ask for help. He literally makes fun of you or gets mad if you ask question. That is even during office hours. You have not only memorize and understand every single page of the assigned reading but he always chose little topics that seemed not important and he did not emphasize during lecture.,Sven Arndt ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Avoid this class if you can; you will get graded unfairly on questions that are completely unclear. Lectures are very confusing and though he stressed the importance of writing down everything he writes, there are never complete sentences or clear diagrams on the board.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Unhelpful during office hours and refuses to explain material. Exam questions are unclear and very vague while the answers he looks for are very specific.,Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,Just a bad teacher. One of those professors that looks for ways to take points off on exams. Study guides didn't help.,Sven Arndt ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON355,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Arndt is one of the best professors I've had in my time here, and is completely unpretentious, which is increasingly rare.  I wish I could take more classes with him.  He doesn't take it easy on you, but he knows his stuff.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"This professor is easily the worst teacher I have ever had. He belittled me when I went to his office hours. In addition, his lectures are worthless so you need to take all of your notes from the book. Do not take any of his classes if you can avoid it.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON147,4.5,5.0,,,,Yes,Very friendly professor. He's willing to help a lot with explaining the concepts in class or at his office.,Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON100,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"He's going senile, so he keeps repeating himself.  He also grades somewhat harshly.  The course material is amazing easy, as it's impossible to get through much with that many repetitions.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON145,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"He can be boring during lectures but if you actually go and talk to him during his office hours, he's very helpful. Besides, he's a very friendly professor, so no reason why you shouldn't enjoy taking his class. But you've to read the class materials carefully though cos he's a strict grading style.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Arndt is nice and funny.  His class is fine if you're good at Econ, hard if you aren't.  He gives reviews sheets & sample questions, but they're not very indicative of his tests, and he even said certain questions wouldn't be on the test and then they were.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"awesome guy that teaches well. he can be boring at times, but he is the man nonetheless",Sven Arndt ,Economics department,,
 BIO43,5.0,4.0,,,A,Yes,"Wiley is a great teacher, incredibly enthusiastic, and someone you will want to do research with after her class. That being said, she is hard. Her tests employ applications of topics to completely new scenarios more than just regurgitations of information. Don't take her if you want to coast.",Emily Wiley ,Biology department,Mandatory,
 BIO043,1.5,4.0,,,C,Yes,"Very enthusiastic and nice but relies entirely on the book.  Does zero teaching.  If you are a good book learner then you are good, but if you are an active learner it is terrible.",Emily Wiley ,Biology department,Mandatory,

 SPAN102,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Absolutely adore her. This is my 2nd time having her (SP44 last year). It's a hard class that requires dedication and critical thinking. Never a boring class with Martinez.

 SPAN44,3.0,4.0,,,,No,Class is more conversation and literary analysis than grammar.Great class-much more interesting and rewarding than typical Spanish 33 and 44 classes!,Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN1,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"if you go to class, study the practice tests, and do the homework, you will get an A easily. class attendance is MANDATORY. she teaches quickly and demands you speak a lot, but i learned a lot of spanish and the class was always fun. her bark is way worse than her bite - she acts tough but she is a total sweetheart and i loved the class.",Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department,,

 SPAN44,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Profesora Martinez is an amazing teacher. She seemed really intimidating at first but she's actually extremely helpful, understanding, and fun.

She makes sure everything's clear and class discussions are really fun too.",Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN44,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Martinez is amazing! She is so sweet and funny, and really helpful. Class discussions are mandatory so be ready to talk A LOT.

 PSYCH155,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Ethnic Minorities & Mental Health Psychology was hands down the highlight of my semester.

Discussion-based course, great readings, would highly recommend for anyone wanting to increase cultural competency, not just for psych majors.",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department,Not Mandatory,
 PSYC155,3.0,2.0,Yes,,A-,No,very interest topics covered. My only problem with him is that he doesn't communicate well regarding his expectations for projects and papers. ,Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department,Mandatory,
 ABNORMAL,1.0,2.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"He was insensitive when teaching a class that involves a sensitive topic. Also, the class involved purely on memorizing contents (which he told us what's going to be tested on - thus easy test) and NO critical thinking. He also taught based on old DSM-IV-TR not DSM 5. Such a bummer because the topic is supposed to be fascinating but the class wasnt",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department,Not Mandatory,
 PSYC070,4.5,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"My favourite professor at CMC! Always willing to help students. He wants you to do well and is always in a good mood. Also, he brings his super cute dog to class!",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department,,
 ABNORMAL,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Really discussion-based so prepare to participate, tests were straight-forward and fair, all you have to do is read the textbook. He knows a lot in his field and is really welcoming. The content is super interesting too. Favorite class I've taken at CMC by far",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH30,1.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"One of the easiest classes i've ever taken at CMC. However, the guy was amazingly inadequate as a professor. He routinely gave out blatantly incorrect information and showed a lack of a basic understanding of anything not directly related to his field of study. Great class to fulfill your GE in silence.",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH50,3.0,1.0,,,,No,"Class seemed to improvise structure. But I liked that the class was almost completely discussion based and he is really open to having you participate and share your personal opinions. Assignments were easy but awkward (i.e. asking a friend about how they related to their race). An interesting, non-traditional way to fulfill psych GE credit.",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department,,
 PSYC153,4.0,2.0,,,,No,"ASAM Psych course extremely discussion-based.  Will often present views/material that are foreign to students, tries his best to explain concepts, sometimes fails.

Tried to blame quietness of class on Asian stereotype--only sore point.",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department,,
 ECON350,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"Bird's class was extremely difficult. He gives an insane amount of reading per week.

He is a nice guy, but not a prof I would take again. I studied dayght to pull off that A-",Graham Bird ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON140,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Great professor but you'll definitely have to do the work outside of the course. He expects that, as a college student, he doesn't have to hold your hand through the course and that you'll do the readings and come to class prepared.

Definitely would take his classes again.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 140,3.5,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"A lot of students seemed to find this class boring, but I thought it was super interesting.  If you don't do the readings, it will seem boring and random.

 ECON50,1.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,"Graham bird is a funny brit, that is as much positive as one can say of him. His lectures are confusing, his tests are difficult and he will not help unless you ask. Even then he provides little help and going to office hours is nearly useless.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,

 ECON050,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Bird has a very different teaching style. He expects you to read long, dry chapters before each class, and then answer his very difficult in class questions that stress him out. Hard grader. My class was very behind, and didn't cover taxes, fiscal, and monetary policy. I had to work extremely hard to get a B+.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON350,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Bird is thorough and tough, but he knows his stuff and will teach you well.  His lectures are far from boring, which is saying something when it comes to Global Finance (dull).  He won't let you get away with weak answers, but if you care about Econ, you will learn a lot from him, and I love his self deprecating humor",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,No,"He is not helpful at all! He doesn't answer questions ever and gets frustrated and a little angry if you ask any. His quizzes and tests are not impossible if you study what you've done in class, but it's not worth how boring and unhelpful he is as a prof. Everyone falls asleep in his class. Bird needs to learn to ANSWER QUESTIONS!",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Professor Bird is terrible. He barely explains anything and is not very approachable. He doesnt prepare you well for the midterm or final. DONT TAKE HIS CLASS.,Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Mr. Bird is an adorable british man who constantly tries to keep his class entertained with silly jokes. I wouldn't recommend his econ 50 for students looking to learn as much as possible, but he is entertaining and good grades are easily attained as long as you speak up in class, laugh at his jokes, and read the text every once in a while.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.5,3.0,,,,No,He tries to be funny but class is still very boring. He never answers questions in class and makes you feel bad if you have a question. You need to go to office hours to understand something more because class is not clear. He doesn't write on board very often and expects you to be able to understand everything just by listening to what he says.,Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Hilarious British Professor. If you really pay attention this man is hilarious. Great for a GE. Don't but the newest version of the book, the versions haven't changed very much at all. Also because there aren't many grades be sure to go to office hours and really make sure you know your stuff",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,2.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Adorable British man. wouldn't recommend for econ majors, but good to get the GE done, most ppl get a decent grade with little work. Ask him about his son Simon Bird from The Inbetweeners.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"I started out liking his class, but it eventually became a drag to attend. His jokes don't get any funnier and his lectures are hard to follow along. He doesn't lecture from the book and just talks; you have to pay very good attention to get good notes.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,2.0,5.0,,,,No,"He's not the best teacher for those who want to be Econ majors. He is very organized with handouts, lecture outlines and problem sets, but does not work from the book but rather ""suggests"" we do the reading. There is not a lot of work assigned but don't let that fool you because you probably won't understand the material unless you do outside work.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"His lectures are very clear and there is very little work throughout the semester. The midterm and final were hard, but he gets all of his questions from class notes. He also tries to make the class funny which I think is very commendable considering how dry Econ 50 is.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Great prof! I really like him and his teaching style. Granted having 75% of your grade resting on one test is incredibly stressful. There is little to no work in this class all semester long. If you understand what's going on and review your notes, the tests are no problem. He is theory based.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Bird is a visiting professor from England, so his teaching style is very much British. You don't have to go to class and the final is 75% of the grade, but he is an absolutely great teacher. He's very approachable and explains things very clearly, and the midterm and final are not too difficult.",Graham Bird ,Economics department,,
 BIOL148,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"She is very sweet and passionate about neuroscience. She sometimes mixes up terms in lecture, but she's quick to point out her own mistakes.

Homework assignments were good ways to bring up my grade, and she's great at explaining dense research papers!",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,,Yes
 BIOL80,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Coleman is a wonderful professor, and makes the class extremely fun and interesting. The tests were also interesting though. They always felt really easy, but it did seem like she would take off points just to get you down to a certain grade. It was almost like your grade was predetermined.

 BIOL80,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Coleman is fantastic! I took neurobiology with her for the GE, and even though I didn't enjoy the subject material, I learned a lot. Professor Coleman is kind, funny, and clearly passionate about science.",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,Mandatory,
 AISS1B,3.5,1.0,Yes,,,No,Professor Coleman is super sweet and always brings her dog Elmer to class. She is super passionate about biology and neuroscience but sometimes her lectures can be a bit unclear. She definitely cares about all her students!,Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,Mandatory,
 MOLECULARNEURO,5.0,4.0,,,Not_Sure_Yet,Yes,Great professor! Has the best personality and interesting\entertaining lectures. Very helpful in class and during office hours. Requires a lot of reading but makes sure to explain all the topics very well and keeps it interesting. Definitely take her class if you can!,Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,Mandatory,
 BIO161L,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Neuroscience 1. She is the most approachable, friendly, funny, up-beat lady (which is awesome for a Neuroscience class). Always willing to meet with students in her office and offers great 1 on 1 help. Makes lab fun! Highly recommended!",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,,
 BIO80,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"A great teacher. The class is hard though, although the bad grade was largely my fault. She holds really fun labs that make it interesting for a non-science major, unlike pretty much all the other science courses you can take here. And they're usually short--another plus.",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,,
 BIOL80,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"This class is way too hard for a non-major GE, way harder than most other sciences.  Most of the labs were pointless and some of thes were really long.  She might be great for science majors, but if you want a good grade, I don't recommend her for a GE.",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,,
 BIO161,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,She is a wonderful teacher. She really cares about her students and goes out of her way to make sure they are learning as much as possible. She lives basically on-campus so is very available for office hours pretty much 24/7 when you can make it. She also invited the whole class over and cooked us dinner.  She is overall a wonderful lady and makes ,Melissa Coleman ,Biology department,,
 ECON160,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Batta is amazing as a professor and person. He is always willing to help out over office hours and in things not class-related (introducing you to people, helping on research, or finding summer opportunities on your behalf). In Accounting Data Analytics we had to code in R for midterms, he will spot-check your code so you avoid syntax errors!",George Batta ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON154,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Batta is easily one of the most well-versed academics within the Robert Day School. His lectures include real-life applications and are relevant to current events. Intense workload towards the end of the semester. Most students in the class are Robert Day Scholars, so be prepared to work hard if you are not a natural at econ/finance.",George Batta ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Class is very structured and organized, which I liked. The lectures are pretty boring, though, especially if you're not interested in the subject, but not because of Batta, it's just the accounting material. It's a demanding workload, so if you fall behind a little, get help ASAP. He's willing to help you out.",George Batta ,Economics department,,
 ECON154,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,One of the most knowledgeable teachers at CMC. Class will be difficult at times but very in depth and you will learn a ton. Very helpful in office hours and wants students to learn.,George Batta ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Batta is one of the hardest graders I've ever had, but doesn't seem to realize it, so he challenges his student to an extent that appears to be out of his control. The class was informative and necessary for my major, but I would never take it out of pure interest or for the sake of experiencing a great professor.",George Batta ,Economics department,,
 ECON154,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Batta is extremely smart and his vast knowledge of accounting is evident in the depth of the course.This course covers the basic, the intermediate and the advanced of financial accounting.He is a young professor who incorporates technology into the course(good Excel proficiency).You will work very hard but learn a lot at the same time.",George Batta ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I had no real knowledge of accounting before this course. I got a good amount out of the material and am glad that I took this class. His class project was about 1/10th as long as professor Massoud's* project, so that was a plus. Sometimes there was material on the exams that we had not encountered before (in the long problems). Overall good course",George Batta ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Accounting is a demanding class regardless of which prof you take it from, but if you go into his office hours and send him e-mails he will get back quickly. However, I found his tests to be quite different from his practice tests-- many concepts were thrown into a problem at once and it was difficult to solve.",George Batta ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"This professor rocks!!! Harvard background, clear expectations, made econ. 86 ineresting, recommend his class.",George Batta ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,He is a great prof. His lectures are clear and understandable. His mixes powerpoint with lecture and bases tests directly off of the powerpoint and sample tests. Recommended!,George Batta ,Economics department,,
 SPAN125B,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Wall is a professor of literature yet has a strong accent which could be both hilarious and very distracting/annoying. She is extremely inflexible in both assignments and communication and easily becomes passive aggressive in person and over email. I don't know how she does in language classes, but she is terrible at literature. Worst prof ever!",Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN01,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Wall is a great professor if you already have previous knowledge of spanish 1.  She is very accessible and encourages people to come for extra help. If you are dedicated in the class, do all of your homework and PARTICIPATE!!!! you will have no problems.  I really enjoyed it, and learned a lot",Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN33,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Definitely plays favorites and can be very passive aggressive. She is easy to understand but does not provide much positive feedback at all,Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN033,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Profesora Wall tried her best with an 8 am class. She's kind of a hard grader. She is very goofy and really stresses participation in class. the more you talk the better you will do.,Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN22,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"The class was pretty hard and there was a ton of homework, but if you work at it, you can do well.  She is also a pretty good teacher who encourages you to contribute a lot.",Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN022,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"This is the hardest intro spanish class I could imagine. Many of my friends are in 33 and don't understand our homework. She's good at teaching and I've learned a lot, but the tests are very hard and she gievs out about an hour or two of homework most nights. Attendance is mandatory along with multiple out of class activites. Very difficult course.",Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department,,
 HUM3103,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,No,"I took Jasmine at Quest Univ, Canada and I can tell you that she is the greatest instructor ever.  Yeah you have to work hard but she works just as hard. On students' papers she writes pages of clear and helpful comments. Her brain seems full of info, like we all wondered how a head can contain that much. Her insights will blow your mind wide open.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department,Mandatory,
 CIV10,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"I am sitting here with a friend who went to USC and had this prof too and we both thought she was so great. I took her for a GE course that other profs teach too. She's the hardest one but taught a great class and is a lot of fun. I loved talking to her in her office hours, she can talk to you about anything and you'll laugh a lot.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department,,
 CIV20,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Aimaq took a required GE and turned it into one of the most intellectually stimulating classes I have taken at the 5Cs.  I didn't always agree with her POV, but she challenged my views and made me rethink my assumptions about the subject matter.  You might not get the easy A you would with another professor, but it will be worth it.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department,,
 CIV10,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"I wish that Aimaq could teach the bulk of my classes at CMC.  She is amazing: EXTREMELY intelligent, witty, hilarious,understanding...  It takes a lot for a teacher to be able to teach you SO much, whilst letting the class run the discussion.  We watch great clips, too! On top of teaching us so much, she jokes and has fun. Very, very fair grader.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department,,
 CIV10,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"I don't know how anyone can NOT like Aimaq. she is fantastic and makes every class into insightful discussions. She is very open to many ways of thinking and to students' opinions. Even if there is a youtube video you find interesting, she will let you play it. NOT a hard grader. I would take another class she taught in an instant.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department,,
 CIV10,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"Wicked smart - she can talk intelligently on nearly anything. Tough grader, can be intimidating, and little emotional connection to students. Still, if you want a challenge, try her.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department,,
 CIV10,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Essay prompts are confusing and unclear.  She gives papers back with no feedback except for the grade.  In her office hours, she is intimidating and hostile.  Discussions in class often led no where, and since we had too many books to cover in a semester, we were not able to delve deeply into any.  I would not recommend this prof to anyone.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department,,
 CIV10,2.0,5.0,,,,No,No Comments,Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department,,
 CIV10,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"She has the most work out of all the Civ10 teachers.  She is a very hard grader on everything you turn in.  She expects you to read about a book a night.  She's a very smart teacher.  You learn a lot, but your grade suffers.  I wouldn't suggest taking her if you are looking at Civ10 as an easy class.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department,,
 GENETICS,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Armstrong is THE professor to take at the Claremont Colleges. I had her for genetics and her enthusiasm is unparalleled!!! I never missed any of her classes because of how awesome she is, even though waking up so early is tough. Do whatever you can to take any of her classes, even if you have to change majors!",Jennifer Armstrong ,Biology department,,
 BIO143,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"Armstrong is fantastic.  I completely disagree with the other criticisms; in Bio 43 I never once opened the text book because everything I needed to know was in the lecture notes. She is a great lecturer and very straight forward with what you need to know.  If you go to the book for studying instead of notes, you'll only confuse yourself.",Jennifer Armstrong ,Biology department,,
 BIO43,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I didn't take any AP science classes in high school, and was actually pretty rusty in science, but I still managed to get a good grade in her class. Her lectures and drawings are based completely off the book, so if you don't get anything, you always have a literary reference. I was honestly never confused. She's very chipper, even at 8AM.",Jennifer Armstrong ,Biology department,,
 BIO43,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"She comes across as a really nice lady. Don't let the smile fool you. She believes that everyone took AP Bio when we all didn't. Overall, she's an average teacher but I would not take her again. She is always available outside of class. Although that doesn't mean that she will help you fully comprehend the material. It's up 2 you. Read the book tho",Jennifer Armstrong ,Biology department,,
 PHIL30,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"One of the best teachers that I've had at CMC! His lectures are very clear, detailed, and he uses many different examples to get the points across. He has great humor and is very helpful during office hours.  Also, the work load is very light and reasonable. I highly recommend him!",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL030,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"The worst prof that I have had at CMC so far. Test and practice questions are completely different. Chooses grades based upon his own views of arguments, and will refuse to agree with other students' views in class even when his is clearly the weaker point. If you are stuck taking him, make sure you write about only what he wants to hear.",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL030,5.0,2.0,,,,No,"Professor Gardner is fantastic and really cares about presenting the information as clearly as possible.  With practice exam questions and availability for office hours, you are able to do very well as long as you put in some effort. Reading isn't always necessary, but being in class is vital for understanding the information.",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"his notes are definitely clear, but it is not enough to do well on tests because they are more like outlines. his tests are tricky (watch out for the true/false) and go in to see him about papers. although i think his tests are unfair, he is an energetic and all around great prof.",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,He posts very clear notes from each lecture on Sakai. He has 5 mini exams throughout the semester. Going to his office hours is EXTREMELY helpful. He's very understanding and worked with me to raise my grade after two bad test grades. I went to see him before I turned in my first paper and I got a higher than class average grade. Great guy.,Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"One of my favorite professors so far, great teaching method, grading is fair and straightforward.  He puts all his (very clear) notes on Sakai, so studying for the little quizzes is not difficult.  Great introduction to philosophy, and is also an easy class if you're not interested in the subject.",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"5 Exams worth 10% each, 2 four page papers worth 15% each and 5 reading responses. If he doesn't agree with your argument be ready to expect a B. But otherwise amazing professor, loved his teaching style specially his examples. He is very chill and also always willing to help outside of class.",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Loved this class- fav this semester! I actually had no trouble waking up for this 8:10am class because I never wanted to miss any of the discussions! He is extremely clear, engaging, and passionate about philosophy; willing to help with anything or even just chat. Amazing class, great Prof & person. If you like philosophy, you'll love this class :)",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL95,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Took Prof. Gardner for Philosophy of Mind and Fundamentals of Logic- two of my favorite classes thus far.  Prof. Gardner is thorough in his explanations and very open to questions/discussion. Hes energetic and makes class fun! Tests aren't easy but if u pay attention its doable. Be interested in the subject or you'll struggle to enjoy it/keep up.,Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"wow. i saved this GE for last because i wanted to take it so little. I took this class at 8am and it was by FAR my favorite class of the semester. his tests can be hard, but you can dispute any question and hes usually very open to giving you points back. very little work, easy grader, and an incredibly engaging professor",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor. Really helps you learn, and very dedicated to making sure the class understands everything. The tests were somewhat difficult at times, but he's very reasonable if you want to dispute any of the questions. Reading isn't very necessary, and you'll do well if you just study the class notes before the test",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL090,1.5,1.0,,,,No,"Professor Gardiner is on a permanent acid trip. Take his class and find out why. He will send wackjob arguments your way and when you rip them apart all he says is ""You didn't convince me"". Sign up if you want an easy A and the most boring yet frustrating experience of your life.",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department,,
 CS51,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,N/A,He is a good lecturer I took a Database course. He gave two mid-term exams and one final. lots of assignments and a group project. But the difficulty was fair enough.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,Mandatory,Yes
 CS62,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Somewhat intimidating and his lectures can be a bit awkward if nobody participates, but overall a great prof if you pay attention and do the homework. Don't procrastinate on CS homework, but if the whole class does, there's a high chance everyone will get an extension. His voice is pretty chill.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,Not Mandatory,
 CSCI040,2.0,5.0,Yes,,B+,No,This was my first computer science class. There were three written tests  (as opposed to homework assignments done on computers) given throughout the semester that were very hard. The professor was understanding when I talked to him in person but impatient with questions during class. He had a hard time explaining.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,Not Mandatory,
 CS135,3.5,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"Need to learn htmlcss, javascript (and jquery), php, and ajax. If you can do this and do simple programs with them, then its an easy A. He gives extensions for homework (there weren't many homework assignments) easily. Not super clear, but if you go to him he will tell you what he wants. Has many examples, use them when you do homework.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,Not Mandatory,
 CS50,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The course web site is well organized and has a ton of really helpful resources, which makes up for his occasional lack of clarity.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,Not Mandatory,
 CS51,1.0,4.0,,,,No,"This was the worst class I have taken in college.  He does not teach clearly, if you go to his office hours he is completely unhelpful and just makes you feel bad for not knowing the material.  Hands down worst professor I have had in all 3 1/2 years of college so far, worst class.  Claremont- go to Mudd or Pomona for this class.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 CS51,1.0,4.0,,,,No,"Literally the worst class I've ever taken. If you don't understand something and go to his office hours, he makes fun of you / criticizes you for not paying proper attention rather than helping. I used to be so interested in this subject...but I'm not taking any more CS classes, at least, not with him.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 CSCI51,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Just do the work - spend hours on it, dedicate real effort to it, and you'll be fine. Art Lee gives you all the materials you need, but is not the best at answering questions. Just work it out.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 CSCI51,5.0,2.0,,,,No,Art Lee is a very effective professor. His lectures are clear and illuminate the subjects. His problem sets do an outstanding job of helping me internalize the material. If you are interested in CS this class will be both easy and super helpful.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 CS61,3.5,3.0,,,,No,"He has a lot of industry experience and it shows. He knows what he is talking about most of the time. His lectures are extremely organized and his notes are a god-send during finals week. He gets some bad rep for his teaching style, but at the end of the day, that is how he ensures that you learn the subject matter. Good class. 3/5",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 CS62,1.0,4.0,,,,No,I used to love CS. Now I dread the subject. Homeworks take forever and he doesn't understand that we have a life outside of his class. His exams test you to see if you can be a compiler. Useless.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 CSC050,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,oy vey,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 CS51,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Exactly what the person beneath me said.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 CS133,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"This teacher is thoroughly boring and misleading. If here were more comprehensible students may notice more of the continuous mistakes he makes is speaking and diagrams. Just get his power point slides and read the book, he is completely useless.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department,,
 ECON102,4.5,3.0,,,,No,"Prof. Blomberg is a great guy to get to know. Always gives good partial credit on tests, and only 3 problem sets per semester, but challenging and engaging enough to make you think and keep you interested. Extremely helpful outside of class, and just a really nice guy in general. Best Macro prof at CMC for sure.",Brock Blomberg ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Blomberg is a very engaging professor.He makes an effort to know his students and is extremely knowledgeable in the study of Economics.His tests can be challenging and it's not an easy course to get an A.However, if you are an Economics major who is looking for a good foundation in Macroeconomics, take the course with Professor Blomberg.",Brock Blomberg ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"What a homie. You don't exactly know how to get an A, but he knows his stuff and makes class fun (""Let's talk about how you can impress people at a cocktail party"")",Brock Blomberg ,Economics department,,

 ECON102,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,awesome,Brock Blomberg ,Economics department,,
 ECON000,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I cannot tell whether Blomberg enjoys teaching or not. He sometimes seems angry when he is trying to show that he is excited. Makes econ make sense though...Overall a nice guy, knows his econ so well he never once brings notes to class to profess off of. Smart. Engaging.",Brock Blomberg ,Economics department,,
 ECONECON,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,No Comments,Brock Blomberg ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,The lectures are fabulous. A very humorous professor who is very experienced in teaching and research. His experience with the Fed and IMF makes his lecture very interesting. His grading system is not as clear compared to other professors. The quality of your answers is determined by how well your answers are compared to the rest of the class.,Brock Blomberg ,Economics department,,
 FHS10,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Honestly, don't worry about all of these reviews. Nita is not that hard and she has a great message that you can leave the class with: colonialism and orientalism colors every part of our society. I learned so much about the world and even though she lectures in tangents, it's an easy class and if you put in the work you will get a good grade.",Nita Kumar ,History department,Not Mandatory,
 HIST167,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"She can be a bit disorganized, and her response rate to emails varies wildly. She also is very set in what she wants, despite not the most clear about her expectations. There was a lot of group discussion but she often tries to dominate it and steer the conversation in her own direction. Be interested in the material to make it a better experience",Nita Kumar ,History department,Mandatory,
 FHS10,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Super caring professor! Not a lot of homework - just weekly posts and readings which you should keep on top of. She is super helpful in office hours if you need clarification on anything! The material is incredibly interesting , I really liked this class!! Don't expect to get an A by doing the bare minimum...",Nita Kumar ,History department,,
 FHS10,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Although at times the class was disorganized and had a lot of work, she is an extremely caring woman and if you get to know her (go to her office hours!) she will be very helpful. She assigns a lot of reading but you don't have to truly do it. I really liked her as a professor and think she is very caring about her students",Nita Kumar ,History department,Not Mandatory,
 FHS10,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,The class was very unorganized and her grading policy is unclear. Intense amounts of reading in an unreasonable amount of time. The class is specifically for first years but she was treating it like an upper-level class. Please do yourself a favor and don't take it unless you truly have an interest in the subject.,Nita Kumar ,History department,,
 FHS,3.0,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,LOTS OF BUSYWORK NICE LADY RESPECT HER,Nita Kumar ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST167,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"Extremely boring. Assigns very dense readings. Discussions and lectures have little structure, and grading is very arbitrary (not easy either, as some people would have you believe). Nice and eloquent, but confuses you with various muddled theories so you end up not knowing what you should take note of. Would not recommend.",Nita Kumar ,History department,Mandatory,
 HISTORY52,2.5,3.0,,,B+,Yes,"In a class on India and Pakistan, we did not discuss Pakistan till the last day of the class.",Nita Kumar ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST160,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Took South Asian Hist. Through Literature. Could have been awesome, but her goals: teach us that there is no unified ""indian culture""/grand narrative. She's opinionated and not always available. She's upset because CMC won't let her teach w/in her specialty, which is education and Russian history/language/government.",Nita Kumar ,History department,,
 HIST51,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Usually I don't take the time to write these reviews, but this teacher is ridiculous.  Yes, this class could potentially be interesting but the amount of reading is a little over done.  Especially since the paper that we're supposed to write is due the class right after the reading is assigned. This happens almost every time! It's ridiculous.",Nita Kumar ,History department,,
 HIST51,1.0,2.0,,,,No,"Nita Kumar is by far the worst professor I have ever taken at CMC. She is opinionated and biased, she spends most of the class time trying to convince us to believe her conspiracy theories without any form of reasonable proof. Unless you enjoy getting frustrated by bias opinionated teachers, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES.",Nita Kumar ,History department,,
 FHS10,1.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Her South Asia class has the potential to be one of the most interesting classes at CMC. Unfortunately she spends most of her time trying to convince you that there is no such thing as culture or society. She's very unclear in a lot of things, but the papers are easy, and the class was easy.",Nita Kumar ,History department,,
 HIST101,1.0,1.0,,,,No,Incredibly boring. Acts like she's falling asleep. Seems stoned. But her class is super easy. Easiest A at CMC.,Nita Kumar ,History department,,
 FHS10,2.5,2.0,,,,No,"Prof is up to a lot of great things. Unfortunately, she's not the greatest prof, IMHO. Lectures were somewhat confusing. She asks a lot of questions (to get us to think), but somehow there was a barrier we couldn't bridge. Class was based on readings (which we discussed), several short papers, and a presentation - no exams or a final! Overall, ok.",Nita Kumar ,History department,,
 LIT10,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"I love Amy Leal!  Great, fun, friendly, caring, wonderful professor!  I wish she had never left the school!!!  She really encouraged me to improve my writing!",Amy Leal ,Literature department,,
 LIT099,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"One of my all-time favorite teachers... she really makes writing fun.  Her texts are classic, but she also mixes it up with some really gothic literature and tries to make everyone really connect to the books.  Her assignments are off-beat and required presentations are challenging.  One of the easy fun classes that will REALLY improve your writing",Amy Leal ,Literature department,,
 LIT01,4.0,2.0,,,,No,No Comments,Amy Leal ,Literature department,,
 LIT2,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Leal starts out a little strange and ends the class leaving you with a taste for old literature like you never thought you'd have.  At first the class is unbelievable because of the seemingly ""useless"" work to do... but later in the semester when one is swamped with midterms, this class is the only one with a reasonable workload.",Amy Leal ,Literature department,,
 MATH118,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,don't know what the previous people are talking about. I had never done calc before this class but understood it because of her. do all the assigned homework and practice tests and you have an excellent chance of getting a good grade,Andrea Jedwab ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH118,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She is a very good professor.  Her midterms and finals are not what the book is like, but they will be fine if you do the homework and do the previous final exams to study.",Andrea Jedwab ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC032,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"She is a very good professor. I disagree with previous opinions. Once you study hard, you are rewarded. She is polite, generous, and beautiful.",Andrea Jedwab ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC030,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Do not take her class at all costs. Average grades on both mid-terms were failing and more than half the class dropped. If you end up in the class dont take it, wait a semester.",Andrea Jedwab ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC33,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"She takes the textbook and puts it on the board. Unforgiving, unhelpful and uninteresting.",Andrea Jedwab ,Mathematics department,,

 SPAN44,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Profesora Skinner was great, in retrospect. She makes the class really easy and engaging so that non-fluent students can actually learn. However, do not take her if you are a fluent speaker. She has a very noticeable accent when she speaks in spanish. Overall, a great professor!",Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN44,2.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Spanish 44 was fine. Skinner is a busy prof- she has kids, other classes, and is in charge of the Fulbright scholarship stuff at CMC and 44 seemed pretty low priority to her. She missed a lot of her office hours and could not offer supplementary materials when I needed help. The class is easy to get an A in without doing the reading",Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN158,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great teacher, you can tell she really loves what she does.  Helps out anyway she can, even proofread your paper before you turn it in, really wants you to do well.

I took spanish in high school and it was really hard for me to write essays, but I got an A in my second paper because she just teaches spanish so well! She is also very understanding if you need extra time to write your papers. GREAT CLASS! I would definitely take her again :)",Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN44,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"She is a great professor. Learned a lot about Latin American literature and history, plus improved my Spanish writing ability. In class, she is very patient and open to answering questions. Always welcoming during her office hours.",Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN44,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,She is awesome! Take a class with her because it's fun and you learn a lot of Spanish. She is a cool person in and out of the classroom also plus the workload is pretty light!,Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN155,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,Skinner is an awesome proff. very enthusiastic and friendly.  Will help you a lot! Class was relatively easy if you keep up with readings which aren't very difficult at all.  She offers to proofread and lets you rewrite your paper if you messed up on some.  Overall awesome teacher. Best for Spanish in CMC and all other 5C's,Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN150,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Skinner is one of the best Spanish professors at Claremont McKenna and the 5C's. Her class is well-structured, participation is encouraged, and discussions are laid back. She is very enthusiastic about Latin American literature and open to all ideas in discussion. A fun, educational class with a light workload! :)",Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department,,
 MATH31,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"There were a number of issues with this class, so I was excited when he asked us to give him tips on how to improve the class. The next class, he read all the ideas (many of which were repeated many times) and dismissed them as silly, or said he couldn't change things because we ""aren't a large graduate university."" There are better math profs here",David German ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC1,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"I liked him! He teaches the core content of each class right away and then spends the rest of the class on examples, which is an easy way to learn calc. some of the prob sets were hard, but all were manageable and tests arent hard if you study a reasonable amount. gives partial credit. if math isnt your thing, i recommend him for the GE!",David German ,Mathematics department,,
 CALCII,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"His teaching style is very good. During class, he teaches new material and then does a lot of example problems. The homework is really fast and easy, and if you've attended class (although you don't have to) the tests are easy too. I learned a lot, and I would definitely take a class from him again.",David German ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC31,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,German doesn't waste your time. He spends each class using five minutes to teach new material (much clearer than the textbook) and spends the rest of the time on example problems. HW is 1.5 hrs due once a week and mid-terms are five reasonable problems. German will give 1-1 tutoring if you come during office hours.,David German ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH32,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Stay away, this guy just doesn't care about you.",David German ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH109,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"brand new course at cmc and it's so-so at best. german is a nice guy but explains complicated material as if students are already experts. midterms were very straightforward, but final exam came out of nowhere. students considered giving up on the final altogether part-way through the allotted time because it was that unreasonable.",David German ,Mathematics department,,
 CALCII,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,This Professor is amazing. He is ready to give as much as time as you want will explain you the silliest of things if you have a doubt without a sign of grudge on his face. You should definitely take him if you gte him. I would have liked to take him for my Calc 3 as well. His tests are slightly tough you should get an a with hardwork.,David German ,Mathematics department,,
 ECON101,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"She's a nice person, but was largely unavailable for extra help when needed. Tests are not easy, although the problems are given in class, she doesn't give partial credit, so you can't make ANY errors or you will get a zero on the problem.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON173,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Not sure where all the negative comments are coming from, everyone I know in her class loved her, she's funny in class, teaches very interesting material, her grading on tests was a little random, but I thought in the end with her emphasis on homework it all worked out well.  Really works to get to know the students, definitely take her class.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON173,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Broussard is undoubtedly the worst professor I have ever had. I waited two semesters to take her Development Econ class because that's what she was hired for but it was a dud. She is completely incompetent, lazy, and a terrible teacher. She doesn't care at all about students, and any coolness factor is completely negated.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS if you think you'll learn anything. Her class is simple in terms of how she teaches BUT if you are not self-motivated, you will do really bad on her midterms. I admit I didn't try too hard in her class but I really regret taking her class. At least I would have learned something in another Econ class, even if I get a low grade",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Doesn't know anything. Young and inexperienced, can't relate to the material.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"She used power points everyday but they were useful for the class (clean, legible graphs).  She also used the board to explain questions that came up fairly clearly.  She wants it to be fun for her students and gives plenty of hints and advice as to what to study for the exams.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"It is true that Professor Broussard only teaches off of power point, but I don't think that was a hindrance to the class. She holds office hours twice a week and really encourages students to come in. She is funny and engaging and I thought she was a good teacher overall.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,No,"This is bar none the worst professor in the economics department. While her work may not be super challenging, she is clearly uninterested in the student and makes it clear by rarely holding office hours or conversing with students on her time. At a school where over 90% of the professors are TEACHERS, she is a RESEARCHER. Skip this one.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,I really enjoyed this class. Prof is really cool and she gives you her notes. If you keep up with the reading you'll be a-ok. She also posts previous semester's tests so you know what format the test is in. Much easier than other econ profs.,Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Broussard is nice and teaches micro well. She does only use power-points, but she does one group project and two in-class simulations. HW is about one hour online work every two weeks and two hour written work every two weeks. (1.5 hrs hw/week). Midterms are easy if you take notes or read textbook, hard if you don't.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,3.0,4.0,,,,No,she wasn't a very good teacher because she always used powerpoints and didn't doing many examples or explain them thorougally.,Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"She teaches ONLY from PowerPoint slides, which is incredibly frustrating. She doesn't explain how to do problems, so the tests are kind of shocking- you feel like the questions have come from nowhere.  She is very nice, just not my best teacher.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Really nice. Fair. But you can tell she is a new teacher. She specializes in micro, so when she started teaching macro, she had no idea what she was explaining and just gave out formulas. But she's nice and funny.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"By far the worst class I've taken at the Claremont colleges. She couldn't teach a 5 year old how to read. Midterms are difficult, you can get screwed over even if you study. I went to her office hours for clarity, but she's unhelpful. I'm usually an A- student but I struggled to get a C- in this class. Not recommended.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,No,"First-year teacher, reads powerpoints every class and cannot answer most questions thoroughly or clearly, often just says look in the book. Tests are much harder than her teaching ability permits (average 23-point curve, sounds like a good thing but isn't). Has long, long HW assignments due on Fridays. Overall the worst teacher I've ever had.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department,,
 BIO071,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"She has a structure to her lessons which is nice but she is subjective and vague about what she wants resulting in a bad grade because she hasn't specified what she wants (very harsh on lab reports--before her I never got below a B). Also, she can be very passive aggressive...and kind of spiteful. Not terribly an enjoyable class. Very stressful.",Amy Chow ,Biology department,,
 BIO43,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Horrible class.She doesn't curve at all when the majority of the class is clearly not doing well.For our first exam the average was in the 60's and she gave out F's and sent out low grade reports.Her lectures are very scattered and she was unable to answer any question posed to her by the students.Her exams are very hard & unfair.AVOID at all costs,Amy Chow ,Biology department,,
 BIO43,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Scattered lectures, unfairly tough exams. For a class of non science majors, the average for the most recent exam was 71%. Although the labs were often interesting, the abysmal quality of lectures (and 4 hours of them straight) along with her exceedingly difficult exams means you should really think twice before you take her.",Amy Chow ,Biology department,,
 BIO43,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She is an absolutely horrible teacher. Questions in class were answered in the most roundabout way possible and her grading simply doesn't make sense. For example, the average on one test was approximately 69, I got a 63, which was graded as an F. I recommend against taking her.",Amy Chow ,Biology department,,
 BIO43,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"While she is helpful if you go to see her outside of class, she routinely fails to get through her lecture outline within the class time. Her questions on exams are very unclear and many students miss points because they don't understand what she is asking.",Amy Chow ,Biology department,,
 BIOL071,1.5,4.0,,,,No,She can be very helpful if you ask her direct questions but the lectures are very scattered and taking notes is frustrating.,Amy Chow ,Biology department,,
 ECON50,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,You learn a lot about the happenings around you as well as whatever he covers from the textbook. Would take him again...,E Aksoy ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,Professor Aksoy is the best Professor I have had at CMC. He is unbelievably knowledgeable on the subject and will apply economic principles to a variety of stories he will tell. Class is not mandatory but its interesting and he is very passionate about teaching. As long as you study for the tests they are straightforward. Highly recommended Prof.,E Aksoy ,Economics department,,
 ECOMNECON,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Great Guy! He spends the 1st 10 min of class usually talking about general stuff going on in the world. He then switches to teacher mode and teaches stuff. You probably wont cover the whole book, but whatever bits you do cover, you'll know inside out.",E Aksoy ,Economics department,,
 ECON50,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Great guy, reasonable workload, and a fair grader. I loved this class even though he got off subject all the time. Would definitely recommend.",E Aksoy ,Economics department,,
 HIST161,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Park is one of the BEST professors I've learned from. Lectures are interesting, even if you're not that interested in Korean history but if you are, you're in for a real treat. Funny and light-hearted professor, super understanding. Lots of reading but learn to skim/get good bits and you're fine. Group projects are engaging and fun.",Albert Park ,History department,,Yes
 HIST059,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Professor is very unclear about his grading criteria and what he is looking for in assignments. He has very few assignments that determine a huge part of your grade and was not accessible at all the week before the midterm. His lectures are messy with confusing timeline. His readings are all very random and I barely learned anything in this class.,Albert Park ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST161,4.5,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"Prof. Park is one of the best professors I had so far. He is very helpful and his instructions for the papers are very very clear. He presents interesting material but he also blends in a good amount of discussion. He is a good discussion facilitator and while he may seem intimidating at times, don't be!",Albert Park ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST059,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Dr. Park has an excellent understanding of the topics he teaches.,Albert Park ,History department,,
 HIST158,4.5,2.0,,,,No,"Super friendly and enthusiastic. Easy A-, tough A. Great diversity of readings. Only two papers.",Albert Park ,History department,,
 HIST161,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Park is such a cool guy and really cares about his students learning. The class is basically just lectures and discussion. A 5 pg paper with 3 topics to choose from, an 8-10 pg research paper, and an optional final 5 pg paper. Kinda heavy on the reading but you can skim it and be fine. A 250 word post on sakai each week too. No attendance",Albert Park ,History department,,
 ART7224,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"He is a great professor very kind easy to understand it is a hard course but if you read the book it's not as hard. The subject is very interesting, lots of notes are required and lots of study time for the final the study guides are long but simple if u just follow the book. The stuff he talks about in class is exactly the same as in the text.",Deepak Shimkhada ,Religion & Philosophy department,,
 ART11,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"This course is the same section, but taught at Chaffey College. One of the absolute worst Art History teachers I have EVER had. Taught like it was a graduate level course. Told students to ""drop"" the first week of class. Do not take Asian Art History with Shimkhada.",Deepak Shimkhada ,Religion & Philosophy department,,
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I would definitely recommend taking a class with Professor Shelton at CMC. Although he may be difficult than other professors, you can really learn a lot if you put in the effort. He is incredibly knowledgeable in the political-economy realm and is easily accessible outside of class. Easily one of the best professors I have had.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Shelton is the most dedicated, kind, helpful professor at CMC, imo. He's notoriously difficult, but you can handle it if you take good notes and put effort into problem sets. Follow his studying instructions and you'll do well on exams. Great in office hours. His students understand Macro on a whole other level compared to others. Must take.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Though Shelton's macro is one of the harder intermediate classes, he will give you deep intuitive understanding on a wide breadth of subjects. Problem sets are hard, and reflect the command he expects his students to have over the material. As a human being, Shelton is personable, caring, responsive to feedback, and flexible with coursework.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON196,5.0,4.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"196 is a very challenging course but Professor Shelton makes students want to succeed. He will meet with students at all times of the day, and furthermore help teach me some programming skills and gave interview prep for some macroeconomic based questions",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,4.5,4.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"As a non econ major, this was tough class, but interesting. Reading the textbook helps, cause lectures go fast. But if you can stay on top of the material, it's awesome class. Shelton is willing to help if you feel  behind. Go to TA's review sessions, they will save your grade. They're both nice to look at during lecture too.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON102,3.5,5.0,Yes,,D,Yes,He is a very nice professor and always ready to help but there is a lot of hw and he is a tough grader!,Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON102,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Extremely helpful and nice in class, after class and during office hour. Work as a group for the biweekly assignment and go to the tutor session for help. Rachel is the best tutor ever. Shelton's class is not that hard, but he expects you to understand the theory and use them  for the exam. Only essay questions for the exam, no easy ones. ",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 196,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Econ 196 was the best class I've taken at CMC. Even though the subject matter is extremely difficult, Professor Shelton takes them time to make sure everyone is on the same page. This is an excellent class that gives you the opportunity to understand growth, pricing, the business cycle, and unemployment at a much more advanced level than 102. ",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Best professor I've had at cmc. His class is really hard, his tests are challenging, but he gives a nice curve. Even with the curve, though, his class is hard.  You will, however, come out knowing more about macro than students in other macro classes. Take this class if you want a challenge AND you want to learn a lot.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,5.0,2.0,,,,No,"Best professor I've had at CMC. He's very clear and straight forward. The exams are meant to be hard but he curves them later so people do well. The textbook isn;t really necessary. Only complaint is that he isn't great at responding to emails but an excellent professor none the less. Also, he's a very funny guy",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"It's an interesting class however slightly unpredictable, his exams are usually much harder than practice exams. Though he grades blind (and fair). There is no way to guarantee a good grade in this class, just try to understand everything",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 102,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Best professor ever. It's a tough class, and you need to do a little more work than other 102 classes, but you really get a lot out of the class. Especially if you're interested in Economics/Finance, and even Government or IR. He really achieves one of his main targets, which is to make you able to understand current news. TAKE HIM",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Super responsible, very helpful in and after class, charming.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Best professor I have ever had in my life. I would take any class with Shelton even if it were named ""2 hours of Prof. Shelton sharing his wisdom."" If u take his class you will have to try relatively hard but its more than worth it.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON196,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"If you are interested in econ, TAKE THIS CLASS. Best econ class ever. You learn a lot about real econ research, and all the new models for unempl, pricing, etc. Most applicable class to econ career except for time series forecasting with Weidenmier. Also, Shelton is very good at teaching/explaining. Spends lots of time answering questions.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON196,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Best class/one the best professors I've ever had. Very helpful with HW in office hours. Takes time to answer all questions in detail, going over concepts many times in different ways until they are clear. Cares that students learn more than grades. Very accessible/nice. Can work in groups for HW. Reasonable work load. Understanding about deadlines.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Best Econ teacher ever. He makes every concepts as clear as possible. Great Pro.,Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Best professor I have had at CMC hands down. Useful lectures and open to questions from students, and he never makes you feel stupid for asking a question. Problem sets and Exams are fairly difficult, but you learn a lot and he is very helpful in office hours. Great guy and great class.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department,,
 ECON139,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,Hughson is a really great and super intelligent man. I would say he's so smart that he forgets that we're students trying to learn the topic and sometimes assumes we just understand what he's saying. Read the class notes he provides and do the practice exams. The labs aren't too bad just give yourself enough time to do them.,Eric Hughson ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON139,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Hughson is a super nice guy. Although the lectures are sometimes too fast to follow, the slides he uploaded are really helpful. Study the slides before exams and you will get an A.",Eric Hughson ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 INVESTMENT,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Horrible class. Hughson is smart but he just couldn't teach.,Eric Hughson ,Economics department,,
 ECN233,2.5,3.0,,,,No,Not a great class. Material is delivered in a very boring fashion.,Eric Hughson ,Economics department,,
 ECON139,2.5,4.0,,,,No,"investments is a cool class and hughson's an awesome guy, but he's just not very good at explaining things. he comes to class prepared and he tries his best, but he's pretty confusing and really dry. workload and difficulty are average for an upper level econ/finance course. if you can prove to him that you know what you're doing, you'll be fine.",Eric Hughson ,Economics department,,
 BIOL143,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I came to class every day and agree w/ the poor review. I also went to office hours and he was still unclear. Karpel needs to work on his teaching, and that's that. Just because it's college doesn't mean you can't expect a decent prof, especially after dishing out fortunes of money. Maybe for some that doesn't matter.",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department,,
 BIO1610,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"People keep saying he doesn't test on what we go over, but just because you might not understand the material doesn't mean his tests are tricks. You need to try harder and wake up, this is college!",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department,,
 BIOL1610,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Other commenter was right on his lecture was pointless, he would talk the whole time and i would write down everything then none of that was on the test, instead he would have very vague questions that could have multiple answers so you didn't know which one was right. Hated the course...and I'm biology major and have liked every biology class",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department,,
 BIO44L,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"I had Karpal for lab and he was fantastic! He never spoke more than he needed to, gave clear instructions and was very hands on. He graded easily and I enjoyed his lab a lot!",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department,,
 BIOL143,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"I disagree with the earlier post. While Prof. Karpel is hard on his exams, if you studied properly and went to office hours, you will see he never tricks you on exams and only tests on stuff he covers. Maybe you should try to come to class more often and seek help when you are struggling?",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department,,
 BIOL143,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Exam questions are vague, unclear; tests you on things he never went over. Is trying to trick you on exams which makes your grade worse than it should be. Couldn't answer questions in class. Lectures are messy; notes from them will be useless. I could have done a lot better w/ a different prof. Only in his first years, but still needs to improve.",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department,,

 ECON134,2.5,4.0,,,,No,Great Prof!  Barnea's understanding of the material is proficient and is very good at explaining concepts that are difficult to understand.  Take this course.,Amir Barnea ,Economics department,,
 ECON134,2.0,2.0,,,,No,"I had seen the material presented in this class previously as an undergraduate. It was presented much more effectively the first time. Barnea only seems to have a very superficial understanding himself, relying as he does so much on other people's publications and not answering questions very convincingly. His fluency in English is very weak.",Amir Barnea ,Economics department,,
 LIT78,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Jamaica is great to listen to, an amazing woman to hear speak, and provides a learning experience just by being present. My class was very unstructured, but also fascinating, though not primarily academically.",Jamaica Kincaid ,Literature department,,
 LIT099,2.5,2.0,,,,No,"I took a creative writing class with her. She is a wonderful, at times nutty woman.  Her lectures (often meandering stories with value) are wholly worthwhile. If you aren't drawn to writing or intent on developing your own voice, this isn't the class for you.",Jamaica Kincaid ,Literature department,,
 LIT145,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Keri is a kind, thoughtful, and disarmingly brilliant professor. She genuinely cares about her student?s success and is extremely personable. Highly recommended.",Keri Walsh ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,1.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"The book selection was great.  However, I did not find this professor very stimulating as a discussion leader.  She also randomly calls on people in class.",Katherine Noel ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"She gives a lot of reading but they are intereand for the most part entertaining. Participation is a major grade in her class, so attendence is mandatory. She grades strictly, but if you keep to her ruberic you will generall make a good grade. Noel has a dark sense of humor, but cares for her students. My writing increased a lot with her help.",Katherine Noel ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Noel is an excellent professor.She presented depressing and dark topics through the required reading yet always kept class discussion lively.Her dark sense of humor, if you can call it that, was slightly freaky but nothing short of interesting.Noel truly cares about all her students and wants nothing more than to see them succeed!",Katherine Noel ,Literature department,,
 PHIL101,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Birondo is a funny, quirky prof, but he is crystal clear and very passionate about his subject which makes his classes much more interesting.  If you're into philosophy you'll love him.",Noel Birondo ,Philosophy department,,
 GOVT141B,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"One of the best professors at CMC! Lots of reading (typically three 20-page articles daily, 120p/week), but he sends out questions before the class - so you know where to focus and where to skim. Lectures are AMAZING! He demystifies complex concepts and explains the causes behind econ and political trends. Plus, he has a great sense of humor!",Minxin Pei ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV141B,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Liked to cold call students during lecture so it was almost like a discussion but not really. Sends out study questions the night before so you know what to prepare for class the next day. Lots of reading and important that you actually do all of it. Pei is super friendly, accessible, and accommodating so the difficulty is worth it!",Minxin Pei ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV60,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"LOVED Professor Pei's Gov 60. One of the best professors I have ever had. I highly recommend this class, but only take it if you are interested in the subject. Otherwise, the readings and lectures will be difficult. I loved all the material and learned so much. Professor Pei is kind and extremely available to help his students. 10/10. MUST TAKE!",Minxin Pei ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV60,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Pei is so awesome. He is very clear and an excellent teacher. He has tons of expertise on everything he teaches. I would recommend 10000000%! He is great for Comp Gov, East Asian Political Economy and Chinese Politics.",Minxin Pei ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOVT142E,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Pei's class was absolutely amazing. He definitely expected a lot of reading, but the readings were selected fantastically, and each one was interesting. In class, he started with a discussion and left lecturing to the end to build off of the discussion.",Minxin Pei ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV142E,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes, By far one of the best professors at the entire Claremont colleges! I also took his Gov 60 course and loved it but this was by far my favorite class at CMC!  Professor Pei turns you into a great thinker so that you can carefully argue and understand all viewpoints on any issue. I grew more as a learner in his class than any other college class!!!,Minxin Pei ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV60,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I was extremely disappointed with Prof Pei's class. He is unquestionably a brilliant scholar, but his teaching style would be a much better fit at a large research institution. Quality discussion during class was non-existent, and he was unable to provide any constructive feedback during office hours. By far my most frustrating class at CMC.",Minxin Pei ,Government department,,
 GOV142E,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"knowledgeable, funny, nice. well-connected with professionals. Only downside: Very pessimistic about China and its future. Can affect one's motivation for improving China's present conditions.",Minxin Pei ,Government department,,
 GOV60,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Pei is brilliant, clearly an expert in his field. LOTS of reading, but bulk of class is based on lecture so if you come to class it's not hard to get by without doing the reading. Work load not bad, two short essays and five quizzes. He is super nice guy too and very understanding. Pei is a boss, take this class with him!",Minxin Pei ,Government department,,
 GOV60,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"A wonderful professor. One of CMC's best investments. Professional, scholarly, kind. Thought provoking lectures. Made everything seem so much clearer to me. Highly recommended!",Minxin Pei ,Government department,,
 GOVT142E,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Very clear and interesting lectures. Very helpful during office hours and easy to talk to. Will help you with whatever he can in and out of the class.

Highly recommended!,Minxin Pei ,Government department,,
 GOV142E,4.5,4.0,,,,No,An amazing professor - asks amazing questions and his lectures are super thought provoking. Loves asking for opinions from students and does it in a way that doesn't put you on the spot. He is a sweet man and knows so much about China and its politics. Definitely take his class if you have the chance.,Minxin Pei ,Government department,,
 SPAN44,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,I had professor Vega-Duran my first semester at CMC and immediately loved her. She moves through interesting material and includes conversation and class participation.

 SPAN44,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"You don't have to do a lot of work to pass.  44 is not really a literature class... you do a lot of reading, but it's not very difficult analysis.  It's more just a general skill development class.  Very easy fulfillment of the foreign lit requirement, either for CMC or PBK.  Prof is a lovely person, incredibly kind and helpful.",Raquel Vega-Duran ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 SPAN44,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,No,"Loved taking this class! You have to put in work, but if you do, you will get a lot out of the class and can easily get an A.",Raquel Vega-Duran ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 SPAN102,2.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"She is a very nice woman who has a lot of pasion for spanish but this class was a pain. SO much busy work and unclear expectations. Had a big group project and essay due right after Thanksgiving with little guidelines until the day before, practically. This class almost turned me off from being a spanish major because it was so boring and vague.",Raquel Vega-Duran ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN123,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Reading was manageable, with 1-page write-ups every few weeks.  You discuss the reading both as a large group and a small group of two and the profesora will come around to grade discussion.  However... she gets really upset if you're even 1-minute late AND requires that you raise your hand to ask permission to use the bathroom.",Raquel Vega-Duran ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN44,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great Prof. Easy to understand. Knows her stuff and conveys it well. Actually teaches you the language. she expects a lot from you in terms of preparation for each class including vocab, exercises, and 1-page writeups but it's manageable. tests are incredibly fair. Im not a spanish major but she made the class interesting and I learned a lot.",Raquel Vega-Duran ,Modern Languages department,,
 LIT10,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Really helped me improve my writing. I was a decent writer going into the class but I felt proud of what I was producing by the end. He is a really nice and sensitive guy and made a rather dull subject (Intro. College Writing) amazingly fun. Enjoyed the theme and genuinely felt getting better paper by paper. Reasonable grader and workload.,Ryan Carhart ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Wonderful professor! He was very helpful and I learned a lot about writing and presenting arguments. I loved this class!,Ryan Carhart ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,A gentleman and a scholar no doubt.  If you do all the readings and are creative and clear in your writing you will get an A. if you do not do the readings but are still intelligent enough to provide a cogent understanding of the material at hand you will receive a B,Ryan Carhart ,Literature department,,
 LIT010,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,Very nice teacher! We read a lot of pretty interesting books and he was very helpful with coming up with topics to write about for essays. Not a huge workload and a very fair grader.,Ryan Carhart ,Literature department,,
 GOV70,3.0,3.0,,,,No,Kang is sometimes difficult to understand and makes a lot of awkward but hilarious comments. His class is largely discussion based and he really wants students form their own opinions and be PROVACATIVE. Definitely go talk to him in office hours before you start writing the final paper because the guidelines are pretty ambiguous.,Myung-Koo Kang ,Government department,,
 GOV122,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Do not take her. When she talks, it's only about her biography and rarely relevant to anything in class. The work assigned has absolutely nothing to do with what she says and very little to do with the class - be prepared to teach yourself everything. Only write conservatively or you'll get a bad grade. She's either right or you're wrong.",Constance Rossum ,Government department,,
 GOVT122,2.0,2.0,,,,No,"Never has someone conveyed so much information without saying anything. her lectures were basically her talking about how much experience she had in the business world. her expectations were always unclear and graded inconsistently. every class ran at least 5-10 min past the end time. it was a fair amount of work, and i'm not sure what i learned.",Constance Rossum ,Government department,,
 GOV121,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I took this class in Spring '10 and just graduated this May. At the time it was a pretty demanding class, but has ended up being one of the most useful and relevant courses that I ended up taking at CMC.

 CALC30,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"If you have never taken Calculus before, do NOT take this class. Professor O'Brien is purely concerned with his own graduate research, and really could care less about how you do in the class. He does not explain things well, and makes things that are easy complicated. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",Michael O'Brien ,Mathematics department,,
 CHEMSTRY100,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,He trains his students to act as a scholar. Focus on student's ability to handle the lab properly dos and don'ts. He  raise students' ability  to pass level instead of please them by lowering  his standards. ,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM100,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"If you have to take General Chem, TAKE KOJIMA! He is great at lectures, keeps things interesting, super fair at grading. He gives you chances for extra credit.

 CHEM100,4.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Amazing energy! If you need help go to office hrs, he will help even if he is just in the bldg. outside of those hrs. Looked forward to going to lecture every time.

 CHEM101L,5.0,1.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,He is the best professor I had ever. I like him so much because he is very polite and respectable. He is always available to answer your questions.

 CHEM014L,4.0,5.0,,,A,Yes,"If you are a student that likes to challenge yourself and you are seeking to master  intro-chemistry, Kojima is a great choice.  He is challenging, but teaches very well and wants to push his students to do their best.  If you put the time and effort into his class, it pays off well.",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM14,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,do not take this class. it made me hate chemistry. i put a ton of time and effort into this class and it didn't pay off. class just made the material more confusing and he expected you to know material he didn't teach nor was in the book. worst professor ever. nothing about this class was good.,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM14,1.0,3.0,,,,No,Don't take it.,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM14,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Not the best at teaching chem, but if you want to get your science GE out of the way, take Kojima. He is the man. Super cool guy, just wants his students to understand what's going on in class and pass. MasteringChem sucks though -- WebAssign is much better.",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM,1.0,1.0,,,A+,No,online homework is NOT useful at all!!! waste my time!!!,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM14,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Kojima's class is extremely difficult.  If you don't think you have a good understanding of chemistry prior to this class, don't even bother.  He uses an online homework system that is frustrating and very time consuming.",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM14,3.5,3.0,,,,No,It's true that he kind of expected you to know AP Chem material. He missed 7 days of class because his mother was sick so things were rushed. His exams are really difficult so there is usually a really big curve which benefits you if you do study. He's available and helpful with office hours and gives good advice for lab. But makes you think.,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM14,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"This man was a visiting professor to this school. He is from UCLA and I will greatly appreciate it if he gets sent back there! He CAN NOT teach. His lectures are ALL powerpoint based, very minimal board work. He speeds through sections and expects you to know AP Chem material. He himself has attendance issues and tests are VERY hard. DO NOT TAKE!",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM15,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"He is a VERY difficult professor. A nice and occasionally funny guy, and you certainly learn a lot in his class. However, he has mini 'quizzes' every day in class and his tests usually have an average of around 70% or lower. Once, it was a 30%. Still, if you are looking to become proficient in chemistry, he's your man.",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department,,
 BIO143,3.0,2.0,,,,No,"Very nice woman and class was pretty straightforward. The first test was really challenging (long test, not enough time) but the other two were more fair. I felt sometimes points were taken off tests very arbitrarily although they were answers/definitions straight from notes or the book.",Jessica Malisch ,Biology department,,
 FWS,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Woelfel is one of the best professors I've had at CMC so far in any subject.

He is a tough grader but if you work hard and listen to his advice, you will become a better writer.",Craig Woelfel ,Literature department,,
 FWSEPIC,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"he is awesome. took his epic heroes class- great material, teaches it well and in depth, makes it interesting, makes it fun, makes it funny, and not too much work, especially for a writing class. you will truly be missing out if you don't take this class. best class i have taken all year",Craig Woelfel ,Literature department,,

 CHEM022,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,You might just want to teach yourself chemistry. She doesn't explain well the lectures. All her lectures are based on the books notes and not her own. I hate that she expects everyone to pass and yet she doesn't have office hours whatsoever. ,Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM15,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She's really kind and willing to help her students. I truly believe that she is a great person, but not necessarily the best teacher. I scored really poorly on her exams despite knowing the material pretty well because she expected us to know too many practical applications that we never went over. I'm much better at just cranking problems out.",Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM15,1.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"You are better off bringing your textbook to class and reading it for 50 minutes MWF. Her tests are unpredictable and unconventional. If you like teaching chem to yourself, she's the prof for you!",Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM15,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,She is so helpful during office hours. She does have a unique way of teaching though that might not be for everybody. She wants nothing more than for her students to excel. She is a great professor.,Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM15,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,She is literally the KINDEST professor ever. I accidentally slept through my midterm today and was so distressed! I went to see her about it and she was nothing but understanding. She reassured me that things will be okay and accommodated my schedule so that I could best take the makeup w/o feeling stressed. She's super helpful. She's an angel!,Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM14,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Says she wants people to like chem or at least feel confident in it- did not achieve either with me. Went to her office hours a lot but she was scattered and very unhelpful. Poor job of explaining difficult concepts and often forgot to teach things in class that were then on homework, used in lab or on tests. Good intentions but failed execution.",Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM14,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"She is awesome! I was dreading taking chemistry class, and now I am dreading not having her as my teacher.  She is there for the students, and her office hours are fun and helpful.  Take her if you have the chance!!!",Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department,,
 ECON134,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"He is so kind and really wants students to do well. During the pandemic he was really accessible, offering office hours 9-5 every day except during class. The class is all lectures so take notes. That being said participation is the difference between an A and a B. No joke it will come down to that 1 point so, talk! He grades very tough at the end!",Murat Binay ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON134,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,B,No,Lots of busy group casework during the pandemic for no reason at all. Very theoretical - you can tell he's not practicing and does not actually use the correct terminology used in the industry. He is nice and accessible outside of class for questions. Typical prof where you can memorize what he teaches and you'll pass. No room for thinking.,Murat Binay ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON134,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Binay is one of the few professors that makes finance interesting at CMC. His class is extremely lecture-heavy, so take good class notes. Exams get progressively harder, with an extremely hard, but doable, final. Make sure your group for the projects is strong and reliable. Do yourself a favor and take a bite into one of Binay's bagels.",Murat Binay ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON134,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Cares about and wants to build a relationship with each and every of his students. Also really cares about fairness between students.

Makes you work for an A.",Murat Binay ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON134,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,Great great professor! Really approachable and the materials are informative and easy to follow.,Murat Binay ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON134,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Take him in a heartbeat: best class at CMC. His lectures are so clear and interesting that you'll intuitively remember everything you learn from dqy 1, and time literally flies during class. Very friendly and has tons of office hours (like 8), and he wants you to succeed. Light HW, easy tests, fun project, and you'll definitely learn a lot.",Murat Binay ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON070,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Professor Binay is my favorite professor at the 5Cs.  It possible to do very well in this class if you work hard and go to EVERY class.

Highly recommend him for any class. ",Murat Binay ,Economics department,,
 ECON134,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"If you're an Econ Accounting major and are even somewhat interested in Corp Fin, this class is amazing.

Professor Binay is really helpful and approachable.",Murat Binay ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON134,5.0,2.0,,,A,Yes,"If you work hard, getting an A isn't very difficult since most of his stuff is from online and even so, he always makes time to help you if you ask. He's very understanding and reasonable.",Murat Binay ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON134,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"He's a good guy, but he takes his test questions from data banks / previous Wharton Advanced Corp Fin finals. What you're tested on for the final isn't necessarily what he covers in class, since this was an intro class. Also, he was emailing us new concepts up to an hour before the exam.",Murat Binay ,Economics department,,
 ECON134CORPFIN,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"I like Binay. Helpful guy, and actually kept class interesting. One homework set per week (online, so you can't submit late, can take 30 minutes to like 3 hours, depending on the unit, so start early). Tests are tough, but reasonable. Your grade will reflect how much effort you want to put in, so if you work hard, the A is yours.",Murat Binay ,Economics department,,
 FIN340,3.5,1.0,,,,No,"Professor Binay has difficulty maintaining control of his class and his lectures are tough to follow. Personally, he is a good guy and very friendly.

 PHIL164,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Such an amazing Prof. He is one of the smartest guys, and really challenges you. If he thinks your paper is 'good', he'll give you a check which is a B+.

Learned so much and each class was so valuable.",Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL033,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Professor Schroeder is admirably masterful in his teaching abilities - he has a knack for laying out complicated ideas clearly and logically.

 PHIL180,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Take Prof. Schroeder: 1. He is brilliant. Will always give you an insightful response that helps you think in a new way. 2. Knows how to teach.

Student of Sandel / personally knows most philosophers you will read.,Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL033,5.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"Schroeder is the best philosophy prof. Took him for Political Philosophy and we had interesting lectures, papers, and discussions. He really does know how to properly teach philosophy and interpret really dense material - go to office hours with friends and you'll get the most out of it!",Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL33H,5.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,One of the best class I've taken at CMC. He is really smart and challenging and he extorts you with counter-argument and counter-counter-argument within a blink. He explains complex abstract ideas with very interesting examples. The readings and writings are really hard but he gives lots of instructions. Hard grader. But you will learn A LOT.,Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL033,5.0,3.0,,,Rather_Not_Say,Yes,"Basically brilliant. Never biased, super helpful/nice, engaging and clear. Take him and be enlightened by how old, dry texts can turn out interesting/relevant.

Conclusion: invaluable class (even if you don't like phil), awesome prof.",Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL033,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Political Philosophy was an amazing class! I had no prior background in philosophy of any sorts, but just because of this one class, I am now considering adding Philosophy as a major. This course requires you to spend about an hour reading and thinking about the texts before class. In class, you have very stimulating conversation. Tough grading.",Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department,,
 GOVT135,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,"The most amazing class I've ever taken. She makes you work for your grade and doesn't seem to really love giving As (A- is a triumph in her class), but her amazing, powerful teaching style will give you more than any A could. LOVE IT and was genuinely sad to see the semester end, only because of this class.",Kristin Fabbe ,Government department,,
 GOV70,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Extremely intelligent and knowledgeable. Great at fostering discussion and really teaches IR theory well while keeping it interesting.

 GOV70,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof Fabbe is a great role model for female students. She is very smart and personable. ~6 pop quizzes because she was annoyed that we weren't doing the reading, but not bad. A lot of reading + 25 page term paper. I wasn't a gov. pro like some in the class and I still got a B",Kristin Fabbe ,Government department,,
 GOV70,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Fabbe is great -- and if you are thinking of Middle Eastern studies, taking a class with her is a MUST. The class is mostly centered around security-studies, grounded in IR theory. Classes require a fair amount of preparation and exams require tons of studying. Rewarding nonetheless.",Kristin Fabbe ,Government department,,
 GOV070,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Fabbe is crazy smart and is an expert in Middle Eastern Politics. She's helpful and pretty clear about the course material. We had pop quizzes every now and again, but mainly because we didn't do our reading and she got annoyed with it. Highly recommended.",Kristin Fabbe ,Government department,,
 CS051,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Worst professor I have ever had. Unless you come into this course with prior knowledge of CS you will fail. Does not teach material at all, anything I learned in this course was self-taught. Poor use of class time (who brings their kids to class??) and very unclear lectures and instructions. Take this class somewhere else or teach yourself online",Emily Navarro ,Computer Science department,,
 FWS010,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"McGrath is extremely helpful during office hours. His paper topics may seem complex at first, but he helps you talk through ideas and gives plenty of direction. Sometimes class discussions are dry, but the material gets more interesting as the semester goes on. Paying attention to his lectures comes in handy when writing papers. Take notes!",Brian McGrath ,Literature department,,
 FHS,3.5,1.0,,,,No,"The material is pretty dry I would say and it was difficult for me to engage with some of his ideas. However, it is one of those classes where you will do very well if you give him what he wants. If you take notes on exactly what he says and basically put that in your paper, you are golden. He is very nice and accessible though. Not a hard A.",Brian McGrath ,Literature department,,
 FWS105,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"McGrath knows his stuff, but his American Idealism class can be very frustrating. The class is purely discussion-based with little structure and he assigns a lot of long papers with ridiculous prompts. It's very easy to get a B, but takes a lot of work to get an A. Office hours always result in fascinating conversations!",Brian McGrath ,Literature department,,

 LIT058,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,Leland is a genius and you'll definitely learn a lot from him but make sure to meet with him when writing a paper. He is a completely fair and tough grader which improved my writing ability immensely. He challenges you to think but doesn't assign much homework  just to read whatever book you're discussing and three essays. I highly recommend him.,Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"While I loved this class, I would only take it if you already feel confident in your writing ability. His feedback is sparse and he's sometimes hard to access outside of class. His grading criteria is unclear and the prompts are open ended which can be difficult.

 FWS02,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Leland (previously a Harvard Prof.) is one of the most intelligent professors I have ever had. The class changed the way I look at the world.

Lowest grade (B) I received last semester, but easily most enlightening.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS,5.0,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Take this class if you want to think deeply and become a better reader/writer.

 LIT058,4.5,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Oddly enough he's one of the most charismatic lecturers around. You'll know what I mean when you witness him in action.

 FWS,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,"Leland comes off as a pretentious prep boy, but once you get past that, he's one of the smartest, most intelligent people you'll ever meet.

 LIT058,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Leland is extremely insightful. He does not dumb down his insights. Those who have only been casually exposed to literature & literary analysis in high school will naturally find him challenging. If you are deeply fascinated by literature, take his class. His commentaries are substantial and his perspective eye-opening.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Very intelligent but poor teacher. Class lectures were great but was really divergent, never knew what he was trying to do in class. Completely unhelpful outside class, hard to make appointments beyond office hour. The amount of writing was fair  but paper topics were vague and he grades harsh. Love his dog though.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS,2.0,4.0,,,B-,Yes,"Great lecturer but he tends to say a lot of wonderful, flowery words without really saying anything at all. When you ask him to clarify things he tends to do the same and is thus completely unhelpful. Assigns a lot of reading but its really really good stuff. Leland does not assign to many papers but he can be a harsh grader.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT70,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"a brilliant lecturer and a kind professor. picks excellent material. his Nabokov class is one of the best i've ever taken, and i recommend him highly to any student. he can be hard to track down/get a hold of and classes run late so be prepared for that.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Very intelligent professor. He is a hard grader on essays, but if you go to his office hours before then you will be fine on papers. Midterms are hard, but he knows his stuff. Recommended.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department,,

 PHIL30,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"Super, super easy class. Very clear about his expectations and very helpful. Discussion based class which was really helpful. That said, the topic itself was really annoying because he didn't give us a chance to put our opinion in there. Just told us what was fact and what was not and that was it.",Eric Yang ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL30,4.0,2.0,,,A+,Yes,"He is a great teacher, and one of the best for an intro class. Tests are super easy as he gives questions to you beforehand. Super helpful in office hours, and always willing to help. Must take his class",Eric Yang ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Very chill class. We just had to read an assigned reading (which ranged anywhere from 10-50 pages ) but they were always really interesting and fast reads. He grades super leniently and gives great feedback. We only have 3 essays this semester (the last one being our final). there is a participation grade, but discussion is usually pretty chill!",Evan Kindley ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"At first he'll give you a reading list of 10 books but honestly we only read 1-3 chapters in each book. Don't buy the books. They're easily accessible online. No midterms or finals, only midterm/final papers. He's a chill fun guy",Evan Kindley ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,He's a nice and quirky guy. The class isn't hard at all. Just 3 papers out which the 3rd one can be an expansion of the second. Just participate occasionally.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department,,
 FWS10,3.5,1.0,Yes,,A,Yes,Professor Kindley is a good FWS professor. He assigns a very reasonable amount of work and gives pretty good feedback on essays. The class was relatively easy and had some interesting books.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department,Mandatory,

 FSW,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,good course,Evan Kindley ,Literature department,,

 FWS,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,bad instructor,Evan Kindley ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,the worst prof I ve had at cmc,Evan Kindley ,Literature department,,
 FWS,4.0,1.0,Yes,,A+,Yes,"His class is very easy and we cover interesting material. He has a pretty laid back and does not lecture. You have to go to class willing to participate, which isn't hard because he has you read passages from the book then discuss it in class. Don't buy the text books, get them from the library andor share.",Evan Kindley ,Literature department,Not Mandatory,
 FWS,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Kindley is awesome! He was always available for papers and chose novels that were actually interesting. If you are like me and you hate reading, this class will make you think twice. I am now more inspired to read. He grades fairly so just read, participate, and go to the writing center. Best class ever!",Evan Kindley ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Kindley really values participation, and leads a great discussion. Although it's hard to get into a freshman seminar class, he made it as interesting as he could. His own work is also pretty good. Rumor has it he writes for Pitchfork.",Evan Kindley ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 ENGL,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,Great teacher!!! And super sharp editor.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department,,
 FSW,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Kindley was helpful and provided good insights. I enjoyed the reading and think the assignments improved my writing.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department,,
 FWS,2.0,3.0,,,,No,This class does not improve your writing at all. I learned more in my 45 minute sessions at the writing center than I learned in his class all semester. He's a boring teacher and unhelpful at his office hours.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS10,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Drop this class if at all possible. Why? Kindley expects you to give ridiculous interpretations of the novels read in class and gives no insight whatsoever. There is no reason to attend this class at all because all he does is ask students what they thought and stupidly comments ""interesting"" every time. His grading style is also ridiculous.",Evan Kindley ,Literature department,,
 CALC2,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Workload and tests are fair, lectures are straightforward and the notes are legible. Krumm's class was manageable, and he is very helpful during office hours, and even held review sessions before the midterms. I could tell that he cared about his students. Had a positive experience in his class. It's a pity that he's only a visiting assistant prof.",David Krumm ,Mathematics department,,
 LINEARALGEBRA,4.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"Really cool guy for Linear Algebra. I wouldn't recommend him for Calc. He's a young prof who doesn't have much experience, but his courses have gotten better (read: funnier, easier to succeed, more enjoyable classes) every semester he's taught. His lectures are pretty clear, it's hard to get lost during them. ",David Krumm ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 CALC2,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"His classes are very structured. He's very clear in his teaching, and makes sure to take his time to explain things. He's very helpful in office hours, and he's pretty funny. Great teacher",David Krumm ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH60,5.0,1.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I have took three of his courses including Math303160. The lecture is well-structured and the notes are clear and really help you prepare for the exams. If you don't want to spend too much time on these courses, take him. ",David Krumm ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH030,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"In 3 yrs he might be a decent teacher, but this semester he was painfully inexperienced, and the students who actually cared to put a lot of work into the course, paid the price. His tests were unpredictable, making it difficult to know what focus on for studying. His course is much harder than other MATH030s. Not too helpful in office hours either",David Krumm ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 MATH030,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,Don't blame the professor. The only problem in the class is many students do not realize that they are now in a college. They assume that all material in class is enough for exams. You need to do work by yourself. Professor Krumm prepares well for his classes and gives clear explanations.,David Krumm ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH030CALC1,1.0,5.0,,,Rather_Not_Say,No,"This professor is the worst professor at CMC. He doesn't teach the material properly, won't respond to questions that he deems ""too simple"" and his exams are too difficult and testing you on topics he hasn't even taught in class but expects you to know on your own. Prepare to teach yourself all the material and still expect a D in his class.",David Krumm ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 MATH30,1.0,5.0,,,,No,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. HE WROTE THE FIRST REVIEW. HE SAYS THE PROBLEM IS STUDENTS. THE PROBLEM IS HIM. He does not teach the material and then gives very difficult exams.,David Krumm ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 MATH30,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Not a good professor. He wants you to understand, but his teaching style isn't good. His midterms are hard and he doesn't curve the class, so no only is it hard, but its also tough to do well in.",David Krumm ,Mathematics department,,
 CALC1,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,I don't know anyone who likes his class. He's not accommodating at all. .,David Krumm ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I have a feeling people will give him a poor review this semester, but take those reviews with a grain of salt.  He's new and still learning how to teach.  But he's also brilliant and is VERY helpful in office hours.  Just beware of 8am maths at CMC.  The problem isn't the prof, but the students.  Krumm works very hard to teach this class.",David Krumm ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 HIST182,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Took history of human health and disease with Prof. Venit-Shelton and really learned a lot! Assigned a variety of projects rather than typical papers or tests based on readings which I loved and was very clear about grading. She is creative, enthusiastic, and SUPER kind to her students! She curated this topic so well and cared what we had to say.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 FHS10,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Her FHS Nature and society class was super interesting and engaging in my opinion (discussions about native land, and colonialism). There were only 3 essays over the course of the semester plus a group project. It is a super manageable class and not hard to get a good grade if you write about the message she wants you to get out of the readings.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Do not take her FHS class unless you are majoring in environment!!! Her grading policy is unclear and she sets her standard impossibly high. Her essay prompts are really confusing. You have to write what she wants just to get an okay grade. She asks a lot of difficult questions during class discussion and gets mad when nobody can answer them.,Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,,
 HIST113,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"This class changed my life. She is SO focussed and helpful, and has a clear direction when it comes to how she wants the semester to progress, with a really good balance of discussions, lectures, papers and a three-class simulation at the end of the semester that replaces the final paper. Class is challenging but worth it. Highly recommend her.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST90,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,"We had to play this ridiculous and grueling role-playing history game to pass this class, which pretty much sums it up. Just skip this professor. As stated, grading is very arbitrary. Do not take unless history major and are very very committed to the field. Strange college class, but CMC is very strange.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST090,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"I took this class as a GE hoping it would be easy. It wasn't nearly as easy as I hoped it would be, so if that's your reason for taking the class then there are probably better options. Other than that she's pretty cool and is willing to meet outside of class to help with essays. You have to read a lot but I think that's standard for history.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST125,1.0,4.0,,No,,Yes,"Do yourself a favor and don't take this class. I took it because I heard great things about her (great prof and reasonable grader), but after she received tenure, she's gotten so much harder. Unclear with guidelines, arbitrary grading, lots of reading. One of my least favorite classes I've taken at CMC.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Such a great prof!! So kind and very accessible and willing to help during office hours. She gave interesting lectures and I enjoyed the assignments. She appreciates participation in class and does a good job of guiding the discussion, which I loved! If you have the opportunity to take a class of hers, do it!!",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,5.0,2.0,,,A,Yes,"LOVE HER!! She is always willing to help and is very very clear during in-class lectures. She'e not a harsh grader, but I definitely felt like I got a lot out of her feedback on my essays. She also didn't assign too many essays, which was nice. I highly recommend her.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST125,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"What a TERRIFIC professor! She is extremely helpful, fun, and overall, just a wonderful person. Her lectures and discussions were engaging and the readings and papers were definitely manageable. One of the BEST profs I've had in college!",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,,
 HIST125,5.0,2.0,,,A-,Yes,"SUCH A GREAT PROF!!! Everyone should take a class from this wonderful woman. The readings were light but super rewarding. Class discussions were great, and the papers were very reasonable. She's funny, willing to help, and open to different ideas. Even with a large class (~25) she still manages to create a community. This is how college should be.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 FHS,5.0,2.0,,,Not_Sure_Yet,Yes,AMAZING professor and person! She has the best personality. She is the sweetest and kindest professor I have ever had. Her class is interesting and the books aren't too difficult (or expensive). reading requirements are relatively light and her papers aren't too difficult to handle. She makes sure you get the material so writing a paper is easier.,Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department,Mandatory,
 CHEM116L117L,5.0,2.0,,,Not_Sure_Yet,No,"In a subject as difficult as OChem, Iafe is awesome. This is my 2nd semester with him, and he is so understanding and relatable to students. Really just an amazing OChem professor. Would HIGHLY recommend.",Robert Iafe ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 OCHEM,5.0,2.0,,,A-,Yes,Professor Iafe is such a great professor. He dedicates so much time to his students and truly wants everyone to succeed. He provides the best review sessions and even organizes reaction sheets and charts just to make it easier on students. His practice tests are essentially the exact same format as tests and he's very fair with partial credit!,Robert Iafe ,Chemistry department,,
 OCHEM,5.0,2.0,,,B+,Yes,"The Best professor I have ever had in my entire life.  Clear, funny, and extremely helpful.  Young guy so he gets us as students.  Simply THE BEST",Robert Iafe ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"Worth getting to know her during office hours -- she's super helpful and knowledgeable, especially about technical things in econometrics/Stata/Tableau. A bit of a dry sense of humor, very caring, and talk to her about her research!",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A+,No,"Easy A, it's a lot easier if you have calc 3 before/know how to do math. She doesn't give you much time on tests, but curves hard on midterms.",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Not an easy pass, but she's pretty straightforward and very willing to help outside of class!",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"She's by far the worst prof I've had here.  As somebody who is really interested in econ, i've been able to power through but i have multiple friends who have dropped econ as part of their dual major after taking this class.",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON101,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Prof. T is extremely caring. Two mid-terms and one final - and one of them will be extremely tough. But she curves the class at the end, and even gives students the option of adding more weight to their final if they do well. She's very organized, but sticks only to the notes w/o real-life examples. I'd recommend - very straightforward.",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Be warned; tests often have types of problems you have never seen before in homework or even the textbook. She's caring and will help you, though. Homework is easy enough, and note-taking is easy because she gives you blank versions of her lecture slides to fill in.",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,I love Professor Tocoian. She's super helpful during office hours and will review things in class if you're confused about something. Work hard and you'll be rewarded. Lectures are pretty straight forward since she prints out the notes for class and you just fill them in. Would definitely recommend!,Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.0,5.0,Yes,,B,No,You really have to work to even get a B in the class. She throws stuff on the exam that no one has ever seen before that is really difficult and doesn't curve it. Would not recommend to anyone.,Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,2.0,5.0,Yes,,B,No,"boring - literally talked half the class to sleep every time. made me sad except when she brought candy to class. homework was ok, midterms were insanely difficult and unrelated to what we covered in class. no word in English language to describe what final made me feel",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON101,3.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"She's a really sweet woman, but it extremely tough! Another professor teaching from the same textbook and same course required the students to study lesser chapters and his tests were much easier! She's funny, but don't take her class if you want to learn and want an easy grade. ",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.0,3.0,,,B,Yes,Super nice woman and a decent professor. Doesn't use enough examples in class. Between homework and midterms it's not too difficult.,Oana Tocoian ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 BIO177,4.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,No,Prof Ngo was always helpful in office hours and he clearly wanted his students to learn biochemistry. The tests were fairly similar to the practice exams and the homeworks. The ridiculously expensive textbook really wasn't used for the class. I really enjoyed taking biochem with him though.,Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,Not Mandatory,
 BIOL177,2.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"If I had the opportunity to go back, I would have taken the alternate Biochemistry class at Pomona with a lab...  This guy is a joke.  Lectures seem to be intuitive, along with the book, but expect to be far more detailed than reasonable on the exams.  WE ARE NOT PhD STUDENTS.  I love this subject, but this instructor really hampered that for me.",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM014L,1.5,5.0,Yes,,B-,No,He is not helpful. He clearly has a huge ego and assesses students based on whether or not they suck up to him.,Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM15,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Tests are hard -- but he will go over anything you need help on and genuinely wants students to succeed! The class got painstakingly boring towards the end, but I will credit that to the material, not to him.",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM014L,3.5,5.0,Yes,,,No,Tests are  a bit difficult but lectures are clear. Always willing to go over the test with you,Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM014L,3.5,4.0,Yes,,B-,No,"Probably one of the best out of all the chemistry professors at the intro level. His lectures are helpful and easy to understand most of the time, but if you're not getting it then just ask and he'll explain it again. Very helpful in office hours and really cares about all of his students. He will go over your test with you. His tests are difficult",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM14,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,Bad for a GE but great if you actually want to get to know the material. He is a very difficult test grader but it's only because he wants you to truly appreciate what is being taught. Very helpful in and out of class and definitely willing to help if your grades have fallen in a hole.,Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM15,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Tests are similar to practice exams, office hours are helpful. He is a lovely chap in general but I dislike his teaching style. There is hardly any note taking in class and lectures are not worth going to because they don't cover the necessary material. Prepare to teach yourself. Your textbook will be your best friend in this class.",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,Not Mandatory,
 CHEM014,4.0,2.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,He is hilarious in that he makes these awkward not funny chemistry jokes that are just plain cute. He is a good chemistry professor i think and he really tries hard for his students to succeed in his class. Prepare yourself for weekend exams!,Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,Not Mandatory,
 CHEM14,5.0,3.0,,,A+,Yes,"He was awesome!!! The class went into a lot of detail and if you put in the work, it will pay off. He is super nice and he is willing to do whatever he needs to do in order to help his students. DEFINITELY TAKE HIM FOR CHEM!!!!!",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM14,4.5,2.0,,,B,No,"I really likes this professor. It's his first year teaching, so he still has to figure out what kind of teaching style is most effective for him. He tends to take things slowly, which can be detrimental if you already understand the material and just want to speed through, but it can also be a great thing when you don't understand a certain topic.",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department,,
 CS55,1.0,1.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,She is terribly unclear.  Her lectures are fumbling.  Even worse she is very very bad and understanding questions.  I really expected more.,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 CS55,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"One of the best math profs I've ever had. Her lectures are crystal clear--you can copy what she writes into your notes and understand it all. P-sets are just the right level of challenging. She always replies to emails, and she's patient and straightforward in office hours.",Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH52,5.0,1.0,Yes,,,No,very good professor,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 MATH052,2.0,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,Wasn't the biggest fan.  Math dept @ CMC is definitely weak.  Seems to care significantly more about her research than helping students.  Not very helpful with questions b/c she assumes you know what you're talking about (which is clearly not the case if I'm asking a question).  Was disappointed to find a teacher like this at CMC.,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 CS55,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Best Math prof I've had at CMC. Super clear lectures, 10/10 would recommend. Homework is sometimes hard but tutoring hours are really useful. ",Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH55,2.0,3.0,Yes,,B,No,"She is not very clear at all.  I wish her lectures were more organized.  She fumbles with ideas a lot, and she gets confused by questions easily.  She was not terrible, but I would not take her again.",Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH55,5.0,1.0,Yes,,,No,Lectures are super clear because she writes every important stuff down on the blackboard. Easy class with minimal homework and fairly easy tests.,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH030,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"She's pretty goofy in general e.g. we take a break in the middle of a 75 min class to look at a math comic/video that a student shares to earn a dropped HW. Her class is pretty slow-going and she let's you have one page of notes per midterm (easy), 3 pages of notes for the final (harder). Slow class, but Needell is funny and sweet.",Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH30,3.0,2.0,,,B+,Yes,She is brilliant. However she is fairly new at teaching. She goes very slowly in content and starts back in a comprehensive algebra review. I know for myself this was very helpful. She is a great teacher but could still use a few more years under her belt first.,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,His class did not help me learn the material well and when I asked for help he did not care to provide it. He is not an easy professor because he does not teach the subject well and then tests you on it with a test he does not even read himself. Please do not take his class!,Douglas McEachern ,Accounting department,,
 ECON086,1.5,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The best way to put it is, only take him if you need to take accounting this semester and he is the only teacher left. Avoid him unless absolutely necessary. Great guy, terrible teacher.",Douglas McEachern ,Accounting department,,
 ECON086,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,"He is easily the worst teacher I have ever had. There is absolutely no structure to his 'lectures' and he often either loses his train of though or ventures down unnecessary and irrelevant tangents. Furthermore, his 'study guides' are pitiful and are of no help in preparing for exams. There is no upside to taking this class.",Douglas McEachern ,Accounting department,,
 ECON086,1.5,4.0,,,A-,Yes,"His lectures don't contribute to the tested material at all. He likes to talk about accounting and its uses, but rarely teaches the fundamentals and expects you to be able to complete the homework by learning the material yourself. For someone not familiar with accounting, this was a very difficult and frustrating class.",Douglas McEachern ,Accounting department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,1.0,4.0,,,,No,A visiting lecturer with absolutely no background in teaching. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,Douglas McEachern ,Accounting department,Mandatory,

 CS51,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Great intro class. He doesn't try to make his lectures super exciting, but if you're interested in the material like I was it should be pretty interesting.

He's incredibly helpful and will always try to answer any questions you have.",John Sun ,Computer Science department,Not Mandatory,
 CS51,4.5,3.0,,,Not_Sure_Yet,No,"Great introduction to java. The class was alot of work but be prepared to put in effort, especially if this is your first programming class. Professor Sun was super helpful.",John Sun ,Computer Science department,Mandatory,
 CSCI062,4.0,2.0,,,A,No,"Although at first he built up a lot of excitement about the course, his lectures became very dry and useless to go to.

He is an incredibly nice and knowledgeable guy when you meet with him, but it is hard to stay alert in lectures.",John Sun ,Computer Science department,Mandatory,
 ECON120,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The class wasn't very enlightening and it was confusing at times. However, the workload was reasonable and the tests pushed you to think, which was good. While Yoon wasn't the best at explaining things, he was really nice and helpful.",Jungmo Yoon ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON120,2.5,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Professor Yoon is a tough professor, but pretty manageable once you learn what to expect from him. If you study the homework and class examples closely, you shouldn't have a problem with any of the quizzes or tests. He is not very engaging, and it is easy to get distracted because every desk has a computer. Helpful in office hours.",Jungmo Yoon ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON125,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"His econometrics course was harder than his stats course, but he still was able to give homework and quiz problems that reflected what was on the exams.  Continues to teach R as well.  Not a bad class.",Jungmo Yoon ,Economics department,,

 ARBC033,4.0,3.0,,,A,Yes,"Fantastic professor. Her class can certainly be daunting, but she also definitely means well. She is very friendly and willing to help.

I recommend office hours.",Ghenwa Hayek ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 CHEM117,2.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Nice lady, terrible prof. Never responds to email and rarely shows at meetings. Talks too fast and doesn't explain her processes clearlycarefully.

 OCHEMLAB,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"As a lab prof, I would make appointments with her to ask questions and get help on reports. She would flat-out not show up to appointments and made no effort to help. I had to rely on coincidentally meeting other Ochem professors in her office.",Gretchen Stanton ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 OCHEM,2.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,Misleading bec seems like teaches everything to solve ?s but leaves important element out. Did not like how she decided to make a ? all or nothing to make the grade discretion large (Likes a 90% vs 70% gap btw students). There are ?s on test didn't learned in class. Told me a C+ (that's with curve) is a good grade and shouldn't worry. (yeah right!),Gretchen Stanton ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM116,4.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Stanton is a nice lady - she is willing to help if you ask and come to office hours, and she has her problem solving sessions which are very helpful for the exams.

Would 100% recommend if you are passionate about the subject, but if you aren't give it a miss.",Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FHS1,4.5,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"I appreciated Stergiopoulos' class.  Stimulating, rewarding, helpful during office hours.  She strikes the perfect balance b/w allowing students freedom and shutting down BS.   Discussion in class was very organic and supplemented by her extensive preparation.   Only thing: I sometimes felt my grade was predetermined.",Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department,Mandatory,

I always looked forward to this class. Highly recommended!,Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,She knows her subject but she is not an engaging professor. Much better in office hours than in class. I personally would nit recommend taking her.,Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department,,
 FWS,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,"Very smart and insightful, expects students to read as in depth as she does. Lectures drag on as they are mostly comprised of her analyzing the poems and stories listed under the syllabus. A lot of reading expected.",Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT091CM01,4.5,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"She is passionate and (maybe too) intelligent and gives incredibly insightful analyses of the poems read in class. She is sometimes unclear and makes minor changes to the syllabus often. We got through few of the poems assigned because the class was so discussion-based- more guidance may have been good. Hard grader, great feedback. Would recommend.",Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 PSYC150,2.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,She is somewhat new to teaching. She apparently thought it was a great idea to test us on 15 chapters with no study guide. She was nice enough to curve the exam but the curve was set by 1 of the 3 grad students in a class of 25. Her lectures were very vague and studying for the 2 exams was difficult because the students were not given any direction,Lindsey Sterling ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH150,4.5,2.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"Dr. Sterling's main strength is that she is very easy to relate to. She makes her lectures interesting and relevant, and keeps the class organized.

I personally enjoyed the philosophical readings that supplemented the literature aspect of this class.",Giulio Pertile ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT058,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Pertile is an approachable, reasonable, and truly caring professor who really knows how to engage you with literature.

He is a hard grader, though, particularly in this high-level literature class.",Giulio Pertile ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS101,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,He's amazingly intelligent and can give you a new insight toward poems and literature even though you used to not have a particular interest. He might not be a type of person who can give you a good impression in the first day of his class and might give you a feeling that he's kind of an awkward guy. But be patient; HIS CLASS IS DANG WORTH IT,Giulio Pertile ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS,4.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"Giulio expects a lot from you, but he is a great professor. His FWS class was interesting yet demanding.

 FHS10,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Giulio (as we call him (not to his face) because we don't know how to pronounce his last name) is REALLY smart, but not such a charismatic lecturer.

No textbook but LOTS of novels",Giulio Pertile ,Literature department,,
 ECON149,3.0,1.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"Professor Bergevin is a very kind and encouraging professor, but he doesn't seem that enthusiastic about the subject material.

 ECON159THEORY,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"A very different kind of class that focuses on theoretical ideas rather than typical accounting problems. Some of the material is really out there, but Pete loves the stuff and it shows. The main part of the class involves him calling on 2 people per class to answer questions, which can be pretty scary, but he's super nice and grades so generously.",Peter Bergevin ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON150,4.5,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,While the class was a little dry at times his lectures were very illuminating and crystal-clear - some of the most clear ones I've listened to.

 GOV20,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Prof Rose is amazing. Class was reading-heavy, but there were only two 7 page papers and no midterms. Definitely go to her office hours to talk about your paper.

Overall just very kind and reasonable.",Blake Hunter ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH151,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"Professor Hunter is among the sweetest, most caring, and supportive professors I have ever had.

But his discussions never failed to be engaging and thought-provoking. Would definitely take his class again.",Ian Hopper ,History department,,
 HIST136,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Hopper is one of the best professors at CMC. He cares deeply about his students, war simulations, and makes history engaging.

I've never learned more about history.",Ian Hopper ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST136,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Hopper structured this class with the WWI simulation at the center. The simulation is a great experience, students have a lot of flexibility, and he is always available to give feedback. Most course readings are concentrated in the first month of the semester, and not dry at all. The overall workload is lighter than the average class.",Ian Hopper ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST100,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"IMPORTANT: We did not receive a single assignment or grade back this entire semester. Although Professor Hopper is extremely articulate, he is extremely condescending (which discourages participation). It is also impossible to participate if you are not one of Hopper's few favorites. Do yourself a favor find a more professional professor. BE WARNED",Ian Hopper ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST100,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,This class is unlike any other at CMC. The war simulation is so elaborate that many non-majors were drawn in.

His grading is not as tough as students may think it is at first. ,Ian Hopper ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST151E,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Hopper's teaching is rewarding and innovative. He puts aside a lot of time to talk with students, and those sessions are truly inspirational.

I would definitely recommend his classes.",Ian Hopper ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST100,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Hopper is clearly the expert on the subject matter that he teaches. Discussion was always lively.  I had him for Logic of War, and the simulation at the end (effectively replacing a final examination) was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had in a classroom. Though there are no tests, he is not an easy grader on papers. ",Ian Hopper ,History department,,
 HIST100,4.5,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Hopper's class was engaging and challenging. He grades essays harshly but is very willing to help if you go in to talk to him. He seems excited about the subject matter and will talk about it. A lot of the assignments are rather open ended, but, like I said, he is happy to explain. I would definitely take a class from him.",Ian Hopper ,History department,,
 HIST151E,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I went through liking, hating, then loving Hopper. He is young and quite funny, but a little condescending with the subject. This is his territory and he's very proud of his knowledge. However, he is SO available to help. Which is good, since he is an extremely tough essay grader. It's a lot of work, it was a pain at times, but I ended up loving it",Ian Hopper ,History department,,
 CHEM14,4.5,2.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"Professor Rinaldi is one of the kindest professors.

 CHEM116,4.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Neeraja is so sweet and a great scientist. She is pretty rushed in her lectures. Her tests are exactly like her practice exams but 10x the intensity.

Definitely recommend her.",Neeraja Dashaputre ,Chemistry department,Not Mandatory,
 CHEM116L,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A+,No,I absolutely loved Neeraja!  She was very helpful and extremely available for extra help and would clarify something for you as many times as it would take you to understand it (very helpful for ochem).

 CHEM15,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"There are daily quizzes, which means you can't miss a single class. He really wants his students to succeed and is open with questions + OHs.

Overall, solid choice for chem 14/15!",Cameron Iverson ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM15,3.0,4.0,Yes,,,No,"I've had better chemistry professors. Unless you do really well, it's difficult to get your grade up because there is no extra credit or test revisions.

 ECON125,3.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Very nice professor: funny and super chill. Not a fan of the teaching style (She writes notes on the board, you copy them down, rinse and repeat.)

 PHYS030,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Fun person, but needs some time to improve as a professor. The test questions can be vague, so if you are confused, you should ask him to clear it up.

Include units on everything, even scratch work.",Kevin Moore ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHYS30,2.5,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,Professor Moore is a new teacher and has a long way to go before he can truly become an amazing teacher. Although enthusiastic about teaching the material when asked about questions he seemed to be annoyed and even came off as condescending more than once. His grading is very detail oriented and exact and slight mistakes cost you greatly.,Kevin Moore ,Physics department,,
 HIST132,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Lower knows her stuff, and she is super caring. It's a really interesting class, and just has a lot of weekly readings.

Overall, Lower is great and do take.",Wendy Lower ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST179,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Lower is so knowledgable about her field, and all semester I found myself leaving class having learned way more than I thought possible.

 HIST100,1.5,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"Professor Lower seems like she would be a good researcher, but did not run her class very well.

G-Coops is the MAN.,Glen Cooper ,History department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"FANTASTIC professor! Lectures were thorough and he clearly knows his stuff.

 FWS10,4.5,1.0,Yes,,,No,"He's new so he comes off as a pushover and doesn't really know how to lead a discussion yet, but really really helpful at office hours.

It doesn't count for your grade but it'll make the class go faster!",Seth Anderson ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 CHEM1A,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,"Very unprofessional and mediocre, (she most likely erased more of the negative reviews).

 CHEM014,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"Straightforward lectures, reasonable tests, and easy homework (which can be done with 100% as long as you do it and not give up).

 ARBC33,3.0,2.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Low expectations mean it's up to the students to take initiative in learning material by reading and writing outside of class.

His classes are easy but don't expect to master Arabic anytime soon.",Muhammad Habib ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 CHEM116,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof. Hurlocker is awesome. Her o chem classes are tough, like probably the hardest class I've ever taken.

 CHEM116,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof. Hurlocker is hard (but she's been getting easier) but SO worth it. Yes, she follows the textbook, but personally dont think that's bad at all.

Fav science teacher by far!",Brisa Hurlocker ,Chemistry department,Not Mandatory,
 CHEM116,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Her lectures restated what was in the book, which I found helpful. She is very organized & one of the only OChem profs who stuck to the syllabus.

She is a good lab prof but has VERY specific lab quizzes.",Brisa Hurlocker ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM116,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,"She is so cool and I really enjoyed HER, however her lectures were regurgitating the book and her expectations were not clear.

There is a lot of reading so be prepared for that.",Emily Pears ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOVT124B,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Pears made a (somewhat) dry subject so interesting and fun. She's a great prof and a master at facilitating discussion.

 GOVT124B,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"I loved Professor Pears' class. She is such an intelligent and inspiring professor. There is a lot of reading and you're expected to participate.

I highly recommend taking any of her courses.",Emily Pears ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV020,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"I loved my government class with Professor Pears so much that I switched my major. Although she assigned a ton of reading, her class was so interesting and worth it.

 GOV20,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Pears is a fantastic instructor. She makes her GOV20 class interesting by having it by discussion based, that way we really get to know what government is like rather than just learning a few definitions. She's super sweet and intelligent. The work is very manageable, as there's only 5 things in the gradebook. Overall, 100% recommend.",Emily Pears ,Government department,Mandatory,
 PHIL20,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Literally my favorite class this semester. If you actually participate it can be hilarious, inspirational and awesome. Pretty good guy, but tough grader so just go meet with him. Would 100% take again.",Gregory Antill ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Professor Antill was a great FHS teacher. Class was Faith and Reason and he really knew how to analyze religious arguments. Class was very thought provoking and interesting. No textbook only online readings too! Only criticism is he grades papers pretty tough and they are 90% of your grade and his grading scale isn't totally clear.,Gregory Antill ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL167,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Truly one of the nicest profs you will ever have. Super understanding and is willing to retell you the material countless times until you really understand it.

Will grant you extensions and grades generously,Gregory Antill ,Philosophy department,Not Mandatory,
 PHIL036,4.0,3.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,No,"Some confusing and difficult readings for class, but he goes over them thoroughly and is very understanding and caring.

 RLST143PHIL170,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Terrible professor. Great person. I would invite him to my wedding, but I would not take his class again in my life. Discussions are not engaging in the slightest. Average 20 pages of reading a week with a reading response. If you can sit there, don't pay attention, then not feel bad, take this class. You'll be screwed for midterms and final.",Gregory Antill ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Great professor! Would totally recommend for philosophy GE, especially for science majors/other non-majors.

Terrible lecturer and often couldn't answer questions asked by students in class.",Jonathan Holt ,Biology department,,
 BIO043L,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Unreasonable pacing with class material, easily 3 chapters ahead of other classes. Talked to Biochem prof and they didn't know why he was teaching some of things he did. Slides not nearly enough for review. Take only if you have time to invest.",Jonathan Holt ,Biology department,Mandatory,
 BIOL43,4.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Holt was a great lab professor, and a decent lecturer. He genuinely cares for his students and I found his office hours very helpful.

 NEURO1,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"The class was overall very interesting, however, she was not very good at explaining things in class and her tests were extremely hard.

 EA30,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Class was pretty straight forward since a lot of non-science majors are in it. He's very caring and understanding, will know everyone's name. Heard he's a little tough with grading labs, but I did 't find that to be true for my group. Tests are pretty straightforward and information is taken from lectures.",David Smith ,Biology department,,
 CSCI055,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Shaar is fantastic. He is one of the most caring and inspirational professors at the school.

 CS55,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"Shaar is one of the worst professors that I've had in the Claremont Colleges. The material he taught was not bad, but he could not teach it for his life. Also takes off unnecessary points and doesn't have a clear grading criteria. Final makes up your grade.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department,,
 CSCI55,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"One of my favorite professors at CMC. Necessary to go to every class and pay attention because he gives detailed lectures, but he lets the class out early almost every time.

He is very responsive to students, caring, and straight forward about test material",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department,Mandatory,
 CSCI55,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,"I have mixed feelings about Professor Shaar. While he is nice and he did get better throughout the semester, it was clear to me that to him teaching did not come first.

I've never seen someone take an easy class and make it ridiculously hard.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department,Mandatory,
 CSCI055,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"Prof Shaar is nice, but he simply can't teach.

His classes are disorganized and the grading criteria is very unclear. Don't bother going to class, Google has taught me more than he has.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department,,
 CS55,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,Just avoid him. Lectures never make sense. Huge calculation on exams with unfair grading. He uses his body to cover the broad when he explains problems.

 HIST059,2.0,5.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"Very slow, boring lectures.

 BIOL141,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,"She's so mean! Racicot is not friendly or helpful in or outside of class. She contradicts herself all the time, and her grading isn't clear. She is vague, and seems really unconfident in her field. All this combined with her poor attitude doesn't make for a very good experience.",Rachel Racicot ,Biology department,Mandatory,
 BIO141,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Easily the worst professor I've had at the 5Cs. Her tests are hard and she expects students to know a lot despite giving terrible lectures.

 ECON125,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Gillen's ECON125 was a hard class but he made it bearable, his tests are hard but he averages them out and wants to make sure you actually learn the material.

 ECON125,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B-,Yes,"Live Love Gillen. He made Metrics easy to understand. Lectures were a bit boring, but he tries. Go to his office hours and he's super helpful too. Super generous with grading, and he's hilarious!",Benjamin Gillen ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON125,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Gillen is so so smart, and genuinely cares about his students. Although he does use a lot of math and theory behind his econometrics, he also splits up class time to work tangibly on problems. He will also take time to answer any question during and outside of class.",Benjamin Gillen ,Economics department,,
 ECON125,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Love Ben Gillen. This man is so funny (dressed up once to match his bitmoji), and the class grading criteria is pretty relaxed. More than anything he just wants you to learn, and won't make condescending remarks if you don't get something like some other profs. Such an awesome teacher. Lets you have a notes sheet to bring for the midterms too.",Benjamin Gillen ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON125,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,Gillen is knowledgeable in his field but is ineffective in teaching the class. He fails to explain econometrics outside of complex mathematical terms.

 FWS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Open discussion classes, very reasonable paper lengths and prompts, lovely stories assigned.

 CSCI181,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I enjoyed Prof. Naumov's game theory course, though the topics were a little scattered. He was helpful during office hours wrt the homework.

Overall, a good professor.",Pavel Naumov ,Computer Science department,Not Mandatory,
 CSCI145,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,He is nitpicky and doesn't care about students. He can never wait to end classes early. Butchered students' names for an entire semester and didn't bother to ask them how to pronounce it. Flat out refuses to give points back when disputing grades even when the student is right. Refuses to bump a letter grade up when you're literally 0.1 away.,Pavel Naumov ,Computer Science department,Mandatory,
 CSCI145,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Literally the worst professor and class I've ever had. Lectures and notes are messy and confusing, and he can't explain the simplest of concepts.

Did I mention he also gives zero care about students' well-beings?",Pavel Naumov ,Computer Science department,Mandatory,

Highly recommend for new way of thinking!",Sarah Sarzynski ,History department,,
 MATH032,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof. Wong is the BEST! She makes me want to major in math. She was always accessible and willing to help outside of class.

Highly recommend!",Helen Wong ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 CALC32,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Great professor who cares about her students. She gives time to students who are struggling (Time during lectures to do more examples, loads of office hour times).

 CALC32H,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Wong is awesome! She is easily one of (if not my absolute) favorite professors on campus.

On top of all this, she is a genuinely nice and caring person!",Helen Wong ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH050,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,Yes,"She doesn't really teach anything but the basics well.

 CALC032H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Wong is a real gem, a kind-hearted professor who truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed.

 ARBC140,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Thomas sparked my passion for learning Arabic.

 ARBC044,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Thomas is a sweetheart! Classes are a bit disorganized and don't really follow the syllabus though.

 PHIL34,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof. Basu is a solid choice for a Philosophy GE.

 GOVT149,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,I really enjoyed Professor Favretto's class. It was not very difficult but the content was interesting. The class was lecture-heavy and your grade depends on only two tests and one paper. An A is definitely attainable.,Katja Favretto ,Government department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Taylor truly cares about his students. He made himself readily available outside of class to answer any questions and was very helpful in these sessions.

The exams and quizzes were straightforward for the most part.",James Taylor ,Accounting department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,4.0,5.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,"This prof is a bit scary when you are first getting to know him; he calls on people at random and gets frustrated when you don't understand.

AlwaysBe prepared.",James Taylor ,Accounting department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"He should not be teaching this intro class.

Great prof overall though",James Taylor ,Accounting department,,
 BUSLAW,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I loved Prof Taylor! A total badass- could kill Jack Bauer in a barfight. He doesn't waste time or tolerate not doing the reading- but he's very helpful in office hours, and I think he's very funny and interesting.",James Taylor ,Accounting department,,

 ECON86,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"an incredibly dull prof and horrible for intro accounting. he writes illegible chicken scratch on the board and glosses over material, assuming students know how to do it. by the 3rd week, attendance was down to less than half. that tells you something about his teaching and the class. he likes to make students feel stupid and he's just a sourpuss.",James Taylor ,Accounting department,,
 ECON86,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"some people disagree with me but i thought prof taylor was very good. He applied accounting to the real world and got me real interested in it.

 ECON86,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"taylor may be ok for business law, but he is terrible for intro accounting. his teaching style is picking on individual students and asking them questions in front of the rest of the class. not only is that potentially embarrassing, but it doesn't help the student learn. they are scared to be called on. exams are very hard and the class is painful",James Taylor ,Accounting department,,
 BUSLAW,5.0,5.0,,,,,"Prof Taylor is the best prof CMC has to offer! He is to the point, and will not put up with BS.  He's invited students over for dinner and has made such an impact on my life.

 HIST111,2.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,N/A,"Prof. Petropoulos is very knowledgeable about WWII. Lots of readings and memorization, but it is manageable.

Also, has an obsession with Harvard.",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department,Mandatory,

 HIST78,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Relatively interesting class, 3 papers worth 10% each and a final. While this may sound easy, he is a stickler for the rules.

 HIST100,3.5,4.0,,,,No,"Took a seminar class from him.  Very into the structure of writing.  Assigns very high level readings.  Invited class to his house for dinner. Talks about himself a lot, but it's mostly relevant.",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department,,
 HIST180,5.0,4.0,,,,,"I am in love with this man! He's full of hilarious anecdotes (if you get him on a tangent, he'll go on and on...in a good way) and truly loves his work.  This class was intense, but my favorite of the semester and the discussion was interesting.  There are only several papers (7-8 pages) and a research paper (10-15 pages) at the end of the year.",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department,,
 GERMANY,5.0,3.0,,,,,"An amazing professor with a real passion for the subject. Very funny and innovative in teaching techniques. WWI ""helmet day"" rocked!",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department,,
 HIST,4.5,3.0,,,,,"Very Interesting teacher. Knows a lot of the ""interesting"" facts about history especially Nazi's and WW's.  A ton of reading but some of it you can get around, not a lot though. Good Lectures.",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department,,
 ECON151,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I'm honestly amazed at how well-produced his lecture videos are. They are clear, informative, and include plenty of examples. He definitely makes you work for your grade-3 exams, 2 papers, and 20 or so homework quizzes, but by the end, you will have a strong grasp of managerial accounting.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,Yes
 ECON86,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Econ86 is a must take if you go to CMC. Ganguly teaches in a flipped classroom style, which is different from the other accounting professors, but I found it to be the most useful way to learn all the content in accounting because there is a lottttt to learn. He has very high expectations, but that is because he cares about his students succeeding.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON086,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Very challenging for an intro class. Overcomplicates things that could be taught in easier ways. Expect to spend 10+ hours a week watching videos, doing HW quizzes and reviewing.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,,
 ECON086,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Took Econ 86 in my Soph year. (I just graduated.) You figure out how good Ganguly is AFTER his class.

Very thorough, very dedicated, guy. You get what you put in.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON086,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,"Ganguly's class was by far the most time consuming course I have taken. You learn a lot but it is pretty much all on your own time. Friendly guy, but I would not take this class again if given a second chance.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON086,5.0,5.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,No,"Youll struggle if youve never taken accounting! You HAVE TO review EVERYTHING or fall behind!

 ECON086,4.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"It's impossible to describe Ganguly. His videos are helpful and its great that you can go back to watch them, but this class is just so much work (really, if you want to do well, you will will easily be doing 12+ hours a week). He will seem pretty tough at times-don't take it personally. Enjoy his little catchphrases, and learn lots of accounting.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON086,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"The best Flipped Classroom format on campus. I asked for his videos even when preparing for a later class. For the record, he was not late even once in posting videos ... not in Spring 2018... so those other complaints of late postings must be from earlier when he was making all the videos while teaching the class at the same time.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"I wish I had taken this class earlier! It is by far the most applicable class I have taken in college and Professor Ganguly is an amazing prof. Hes tough, the class is A TON of work but you leave really knowing your stuff!",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON086,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"This was one of the most condescending teachers I have ever had. His class is at best hard to follow and poorly organized. He also blatantly lied about how he creates tests saying he wouldn't use the textbook for specific questions, however, in office hours, he told me that he created several questions in direct reference to the textbook.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON151,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Flipped classroom was PHENOMENAL!  Much better than I imagined.  Yes, it was a bit annoying that videos were often posted late this first time around, but each time he invited students to request extra time if they needed it.  I asked for extension several times, and got no issues.  So did my friends.  So, he made accommodations for the lateness.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,,
 ECON151,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Professor Ganguly tried a flipped classroom with us for the first time, so he was super late getting the videos to us (would put them out at like 8 or 9 pm the night before they were due the next day by noon), yet held us to strict deadlines which was very frustrating. That shouldn't be a problem in the future, however as the videos are made now.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON151,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"This prof is quite the badass: extremely clear, friendly, and energetic. Class is much more interesting than the typical Econ class, and flipped classroom was much better than you'd think. His tests are brutally straightforward if you study - no surprises (some of the questions were much, much easier than what you do in class). Recommend  100%",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON151,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,"You don't have much choice for professors if you have to take this class, and there are very few people who take this subject for fun. The class is hard but if you really apply yourself you should be fine. The flipped classroom helps a lot because it makes you study the material over and over again. Study hard for the midterms, they're brutal.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON086,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Enjoyed the class very much.  Not sure what this ""ferocious"" stuff is.  Last semester his class of 30ish had like 10 As and 15 Bs if I remember right.  If you want easier classes go be a Psych major.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON086,3.5,4.0,Yes,,B+,No,"This class was one of the most difficult classes, but also made me decide to become and Econ/Accounting major. This class is very very fast paced, so make sure to pay attention.  You will learn A LOT abut accounting, this is the sort of class where you will get out as much as you put in.  Would not recommend as an elective!!",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,3.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,Really loves accounting. Can be helpful in office hours. Big on group projects and problem sets. Make a lot of errors during lectures. Tries to be very personable. Tries to trick you a bit on the tests.,Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON086,2.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Crazy expectations for a introductory accounting class. Super difficult concepts that are not clearly defined. Very wordy and hard to follow correspondence, class notes and lectures. ",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON086,2.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,No,"Complicates accounting to the highest degree. Think it was impossible to be assigned a paper and be critiqued on writing ability in an accounting class? Think again.  He's terribly confusing in class and easily has one of the largest egos of any professor at CMC. Do not, absolutely DO NOT take him. It's not easier nor better than Massoud's class",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON086,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,I don't think I would've liked accounting/decided to be an Econ-Accounting major if it weren't for professor Ganguly. He's funny and extremely helpful both inside and outside of the classroom,Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,,
 ECON151,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very useful class.  If you're into starting your small business, you will love it.  Concepts are hard, the textbook is way too unnecessarily hard to follow, but becomes clearer if you follow class. Don't take it in your last semester, because the last week gets hectic.  My one complaint is that he could be more accomodating of graduating seniors.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor.  Turned me into an econ-accounting major.  This is a course you will work hard for, and the exams are tough, but the overall grading ends up being half the class A's and B's.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Ganguly is a nice guy. He is articulate, loud, constantly repeating himself. However, I cannot begin to tell you how ridiculous this class is. Impossible for an intro class. Expects way way too much from everyone. Tests are ferociously hard and the term project will have you running in circles. NOT an intro professor. Intelligent at highest level.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department,,
 GOV112B,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Pay attention in class when he goes through the cases and will do well. 1 paper, a midterm, a final, and two case presentations. Doesn't grade very difficultly as long as put in the work and study well for exams",Ralph Rossum ,Government department,Mandatory,

 GOVT112A,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Teaches only through lecturing and doesnt engage with students. Often has anecdotes that can be somewhat entertaining but arent useful in terms of the tests or material. Not as easy of a class as his reputation on campus suggests.,Ralph Rossum ,Government department,Not Mandatory,
 GOV20,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"A true legend and scholar. Not graded on many things but criteria is vert clear and if you put in the work an A should be achievable. Very lecture heavy, class can sometimes get tedious but he is a super knowledgable guy. If you are into gov and do the readings you will get a lot out of the class, if you are not it is feasible to flourish.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department,,
 GOV020,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"A truly wonderful man. Does not assign any homework, your grade consists of a midterm, final paper, and final test. He will stand up and speak for the entire time but you only need to take notes when you directly ask what is on the test a few days before. Tests are not difficult. Enjoy the class",Ralph Rossum ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOVT153,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,He's definitely very right wing in his politics. Needs to be more impartial fair and balanced. I felt it was manipulative.,Ralph Rossum ,Government department,Mandatory,Yes
 GOVT095,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Prof Rossum is probably my favorite prof so far.  He is clear, intelligent, and experienced.  Intro to Law has been an amazing experience, there has been a ton of reading.  At one point, I had two days to read a 350 page book, so get ready to hunker down.  Also, he makes his right-wing political views quite apparent, especially when not asked.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department,Not Mandatory,
 GOV95,4.0,3.0,,,B+,Yes,"Definitely one of the smartest and most well known (especially in the law community) professors at CMC. Genuinely nice guy, and is much better in office hours.

 GOVT153,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"While Rossum's lectures can be a bit dry, he really knows his stuff, and he'll try to make it interesting as often as possible.  His passion for the subject (the American Founding) was evident, and made the subject much more enjoyable.  Assignments are minimal.  He grades fairly, and is lax on due dates.  Overall, one of my favorite profs at CMC.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department,,

 GOVT90,3.0,3.0,,,,,"While he was a good prof. and the class was worthwhile, I was a little bothered by the way he made his political views abundantly clear. His love of Scalia and the Right made the class less about education and more about indoctrination. He sometimes couldn't tell us the other point of view, which shouldn't be the case.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department,,
 GOV90,3.5,4.0,,,,,"Rossum is a great lecturer and you know the Supreme Court cases well but there isnt much discussion.

 GOV90,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Smart, smart guy. ""Fair"" grader. I probably would have learned a lot more in his class if I did any of the reading, but it was still really interesting. Boring lectures, but once in a while he'll slip in a joke that is hilarious if you can catch it -- most people don't.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department,,
 GOV91,3.5,2.0,,,,,"My favorite professor ever. Maybe because the material was very interesting, and maybe because he graded me easily.  Just do the reading, and you'll be fine even if you go to class once a month.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department,,

 ECON187,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"One of my favorite classes and professors at CMC. It's helpful to take Statistics or Metrics before enrolling in this class, but Professor Bjerk does a great job explaining the material clearly and thoroughly. I loved how we learned through relevant Economic papers. Everything felt very applicable.",David Bjerk ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON187,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I LOVED Prof Bjerk. An econ class that really made you think with a professor who took think the time to answer everyone's question.

 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Bjerk is incredible. He's very down to earth, easy to talk with, and a fair grader - the kind of professor who made me WANT to work really hard. The discussions we had as a class were intriguing and made the concepts and theory seem very relevant. Homework is quite manageable. I would highly recommend going to the weekly homework help sessions.",David Bjerk ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,Awesome Professor. A must take. Not too much homework. The homework is important and is meant to help you. Tests test how well you comprehend the info in different situations. They will make you think. Not too much homework. Once a week. Woud take again!,David Bjerk ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.5,3.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Bjerk makes micro as interesting as a micro class can be (which imo is not the most exciting subject). He is super clear, his slides are very understandable, you do not need to read the book, let alone buy it, and the workload is light. His tests can be tricky and conceptual, but people have gotten 100% on them too.",David Bjerk ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,"I just loved his class. One of the BEST classes that I took at CMC. He is a great lecturer. Simply by showing up to the class and sitting there, you can learn a lot. (Of course you need to work to get an A) His tests are pretty straight forward, and he lets you bring a cheat sheet. I'm definitely going to take this class again!",David Bjerk ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A,No,Micro with him was pretty straightforward (and dare I say easy). His exam questions were very conceptual and thus not bad at all if you grasp the concepts. As a bonus he's cute so you feel slightly more motivated to drag yourself to lecture at 8AM...,David Bjerk ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,Yes,,,No,"While the pace of the class was quick, I began to appreciate Bjerk more and more throughout the semester. He is clear, nice, and engaging. When he strays away from the theory and computations and discusses practical stuff, the class becomes extremely interesting. The tests are hard to ace, but are fair and completely feasible. Take him for 101!",David Bjerk ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Bjerk is extremely attentive, interested, and enthusiastic. He grades pretty difficultly and doesn't follow the textbook much at all, leaving lectures as the primary source for information, so you have to pay attention. Also, lecture slides are left blank so you have to attend class.",David Bjerk ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Professor Bjerk is probably one of the best professors I've had at CMC. I went into this class knowing NOTHING about econ (I didn't learn anything in econ 50), but Bjerk taught concepts from the basics. He's clear and effective. If you do the weekly homework (4ish easy problems), online readings, and actually study for midterms, you can get an A.",David Bjerk ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"Professor Bjerk is a nice guy. Always teaches with Powerpoint slides. There is a lot of information, so don't plan on missing class. You have weekly homework problem sets graded on completion, 2 midterms and one cum. final. The tests are fair, but a bit tricky. Be prepared to study hard before tests.",David Bjerk ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"A very organized professor who makes himself available for his students. Problem sets help you understand the material. Although, the book is not as useful, if you listen in class and do the homework, you will do well.",David Bjerk ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Micro: His lectures are clear and he is very helpful during office hours. I would strongly recommend using a different texbook than the one he uses though(Varian), as it lacks examples and is very bland. He's not good at giving partial credit during exams, which definately bothered many students. Overall, I really enjoyed the class!",David Bjerk ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"This is a decent class. The issue is the lack of practice students get with the material. If you are good at math, this class is simple. If you are okay at math, this class is decent. Textbook is terrible and if you want practice with the material, it would help to just buy a good textbook. The concepts are tough and he is generally theory-based",David Bjerk ,Economics department,,
 PSYC37,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Day is a funny guy who cares about his students. The class material is really straight forward, but you won't do well on the quizzes and papers if you don't do the readings or show up to class.",David Day ,Psychology department,Mandatory,

If you put in the time and effort, he will work with you.", Andrew Finley ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Yes, Finley is boring, but he is also very consistent and does not throw curveballs on exams. If you pay attention in class you will do well because exams are similar to class. He offers plenty of practice problems. He cares about his students learning accounting and effort. He did not make the class any easier during the pandemic which felt unfair", Andrew Finley ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON152,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Really great professor! The lectures are super clear. He provides an outline of the lecture that you can print out and write notes in. It's mostly example-based, which I really found useful. The exams are comprehensive so be ready to apply multiple tax rules to one case. The homework and cases are fair and don't take too much time.", Andrew Finley ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,C-,No,"Extremely difficult, unhelpful. Guy is a total robot and an awful teacher. Lectures are guided, fill in the blanks, however he tests on conceptual things that aren't covered in the lectures. Sucks", Andrew Finley ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON86,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Finley has changed his curriculum to make his class a lot better. He provides notes for the class to print out that make everything really clear and easy to review. A bit dry, but he gets the job done and has a subtle sense of awkward humor.", Andrew Finley ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON152,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"A very organized Professor who really knows his stuff. He makes handouts for every single chapter that make it really clear what he will be testing you on.

 ECON152,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Definitely take Finley for Tax Planning. He was once a Tax Professional, so this is his area of expertise, and he truly displays it.

Highly recommend!", Andrew Finley ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON086,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,He's still a new prof. Could definitely spice up his teaching style. Cannot tell what is or isn't important based on lectures. I feel like if I went to more office hours I would've had a better idea of what he expected., Andrew Finley ,Economics department,,
 ECON86,1.0,5.0,Yes,,Rather not say,Yes,1) HE IS THE WORST! LITERALLY.  2) DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU WANT TO PURSUE AN ECON/ACCOUNTING DEGREE. 3) HE READS OFF THE SLIDES AND EXPLAINS NOTHING 4) HIS HOMEWORKS ARE ONLINE AND ARE 100 TIMES HARDER THAN WHAT HE TEACHES IN CLASS 5) HE WONT CURVE THE CLASS EVEN IF AVERAGE GRADE IS A FAIL 6) TOO HARD FOR AN INTRO CLASS 7) RUINS GPA, Andrew Finley ,Economics department,,

 MATH032,3.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Easily one of the coolest professors at CMC. Lectures are given to the students and class time became office hours. Typical math exams turned into essay exams, which he might continue doing when we get back on campus. Didn't really retain any material but a fun class for math GE",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH032H,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,A,No,"I did not like prof Nelson. Not only attendance wasn't required, he literally did not give lectures. He just dropped a lecture pdf and students read it themselves.

 MATH032,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,No,"Nelson lectures really quietly and kinda covers the whiteboard while he writes.

 CALC32,4.0,2.0,Yes,No,A,No,"He's an awkward dude, but he teaches math well. He lectures fast and often makes simple mistakes, but he is very gracious when his students correct him.

Basically, its all lecture.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH31,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I took Calculus IIA which is intended for freshman who took ap calc. This class was like half review half new content.

The grading scale makes it easy to do well in the class.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 MATH032,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Nelson talks super quietly and rushes through the lectures. But don't fret, this is an easy A.

 MATH32,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"A solid choice for a math professor.

Professor Nelson has his own textbook for this class and it is AMAZING. I reference it constantly.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH060,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Nelson is currently my favorite teacher CMC. He is extremely kind and helpful outside of class.

 MATH060,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Linear Algebra with Professor Nelson is definitely a great experience as far as you don't miss out.

Sam is a very nice professor and definitely one of the best in CMC. Definitely recommend!",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH31,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Really nice guy, super helpful in office hours. Homework every week (except before midterms). Extra points on homework will save your grade.

Get ready for math jokes.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH032,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Taken CalculusII with professor Nelson, here's what I want to say: he is a pure mathematical genius and a CMC gem. As he says, there are 70% of Math that can be told easy way, but it is not yet told by other professors, and there is the rest 30% that is just plain hard. He makes concepts so simple, but efficient, and is always there to help. Take!",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,

 CALC32,3.0,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"I was a little thrown off at the beginning with the notation and proof-heavy questions, but it is honestly standard practice in math at the 5Cs.

 MATH32,1.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,Terrible class. Worst class I have ever had at 5C. I personally am a big fan of mathematics but this course is so boring from the beginning to the end. He probably thought he was super cool but he's so lame. ,Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,,

 MATH55,3.5,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Although lectures were cryptic and I was honestly confused so many times throughout the semester, he was incredibly helpful. The exams are really easy and test only surface-level stuff; if you study his notes before them, you can do very well even if you generally don't attend class. If you want to properly hear his lectures, try to sit in front.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH060,3.0,1.0,,,C-,No,"Lectures were relatively hard to follow, but he posts his lecture notes online so it's easy to pick up the material at your own pace.

A great prof if you don't rely on lectures to learn",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 CALC32,4.0,3.0,,,B+,No,"Great teacher as long as you go in with an open mind.  His lectures are very wordy but it helps a lot when looking over your notes.

 CALC030,3.5,2.0,,,,No,Professor Nelson's grading system makes it pretty easy to get a decent grade in his class. He basically whispers though so you need to sit in the very front to hear. He is very open to helping out during office hours.,Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH50,4.5,2.0,,,,No,"He is a boss. Super nice, never needed to use textbook, didn't have to go to class, didn't pay attention just study for midterms and quizzes and do the little homework there is. Take his class!",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH55,3.5,3.0,,,,No,"Prof Nelson lectures quietly, and when he's sure of what he's talking about, lectures are interesting. He seems an extremely intelligent mathematician, but often makes mistakes in his lectures, and gets flustered, which can be  confusing if the mistake is not as simple or apparent to the students. Very helpful in office hours. Take Discrete Math.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,,
 LIALG60,3.0,2.0,,,,No,"LINEAR ALGEBRA-I very rarely went to class. I did all the homework. I showed up for the tests and put one night of studying in before each test. And I received a flat B.

Moderately Easy plus lax attendance policy :)",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH31,3.5,4.0,,,,No,"Prof Sam is a great guy but his Calc II class is a lot harder than these ratings would have you believe.  HW and Quizzes were fine but exams were hard - mostly because you run out of time due to tedious algebra.  Sam also likes to give really easy example problems (like integrate x^2) and really difficult test problems, not cool.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH32,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"Having a quiz every Friday was a bummer, but only one homework assignment is due each week, and if you paid attention at all, you can tell exactly what the one-question quiz will be.  Extremely helpful prof and a generous grading system.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH60,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"Definitely one of the best professors I've had. His lectures may not make sense at first as he is fairly abstract, but utilizes enough examples to get one familiar with abstractions in math.

 MATH31,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"Prof Nelson is the best math instructor I have ever had, bar none. I was not planning on studying math beyond Calc 2, but Professor Nelson's course was so interesting that I would now major in math if I could still change majors. He teaches math as an art rather than emphasize rote memorization. Take at least one class from him before graduation.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH050,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"very nice and friendly guy! math has always been my least fav subject but he was super helpful in office hours.

Definitely need to study and do lots of practice problems for success.,Mary Evans ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON050,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,Prof. Evans is AMAZING for Econ50. She explains the intuition behind concepts with a lot of clarity. Homework and practice problems support your learning.

Would definitely take a class with her again!,Mary Evans ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON050,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Mary is difficult but the BEST option for a freshman that wants to major in econ.

 ECON050,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Evans is a god! Prior to econ 50, I had never taken econ before. Her class was well-structured, entertaining, and engaging.

 ECON050,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Evans is AMAZING. ECON50 with her was always interesting and well structured. The class is very well organized and Prof Evans is quite accessible outside class.

Not an easy A, but not extremely difficul to  either.",Mary Evans ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON171,3.0,3.0,Yes,,A,No,Evan's Environmental Econ class is more economic math and theory based that I would have initially thought.

 ECON171,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"I would recommend Prof. Evans for any class because of how clear, organized and helpful she is, but especially for environmental econ because of the optional (really) extra materials and readings she provided in an attempt to make the subject relevant.

Brilliant and wonderful. TAKE!!,Heather Ferguson ,History department,Mandatory,
 55,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Easily the most underrated professor at CMC. Brilliant, invested in her students' learning, understands how to ask questions and teach students without telling them.

Extremely helpful during office hours - make sure to take advantage. Tests were very manageable. Go to class, do the homework, and study for tests and you will get the grade you want. By far the best math professor I've ever had.",Mark Huber ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 MATH151,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"Very clear lectures. Problem solving and technique focus rather than theory focus- he often glosses or omits proofs of the algorithms he teaches you. This prepares students well for the actuarial exams or other tests, but those looking for purer math might want more. Never uses the text book.",Mark Huber ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH32H,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"HUBER IS AMAZING. LOVE THIS MAN. Incredibly helpful and approachable at office hours - take advantage of it for homework. Super smart, will explain things until you get it, the tests are very manageable - he lets you bring in equation/example sheets. He also adds a very generous curve at the end. Favorite class this semester - Huber is the best!!!",Mark Huber ,Mathematics department,,

 FWS10,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,Yes,"Professor Morrison gives great writing advice and guidance. His film choices for the class are engaging and the workload is reasonable.

Highly recommend him.",James Morrison ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 MS050,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Such a sweet man! Made film theory interesting and accessible in his Intro to Film summer class. Because it was summer, it was a small evening class and relatively quiet. I imagine in the regular semester his classes are more lively. Would recommend!",James Morrison ,Literature department,,
 LIT131,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Prof. Morrison is a ray of sunshine. Always giggling and very understanding/helpful.

Super manageable and fun!!",James Morrison ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT139,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"Prof Morrison is such a lovely guy, he is organized, funny, and clearly passionate about film theory.

 LIT137,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I LOVE HIM. Bio major, but had him for my FWS and took him again for my Lit GE (U.S. Gay & Lesbian Film) because he is so amazing.

Almost switched my major after taking his classes, I loved them so much.",James Morrison ,Literature department,,
 FWS10,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,Professor Morrison is awesome and one of the best professors I have had at CMC. His lectures are interesting and cover material that many students have not read/watched.

 FWS10,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"Professor Morrison was my FWS professor and he was absolutely AWESOME. I loved his class. It was the first class at CMC where the time flew by.

 FWS10,1.5,4.0,Yes,,A,No,"Prof Morrison is one of the worst professors I have ever taken at CMC. His lectures are brutally boring and he talks too much.

Avoid at all cost.",James Morrison ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS10,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"FWS 10: Literature and Film:I loved this class!

Im not a lit major, but I am taking another class with him some time soon!",James Morrison ,Literature department,,

 LIT131,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"He is a great professor, and definitely knows a lot about film history. He is a hard grader, but only because he wants you to learn about the topics in depth.

 GOV142,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,A,No,Don't think online was Terril's forte. He's nice but a bit bumbling. Disorganized with time lines (which was tough in a journalism class where deadlines are usually emphasized). Tries to help: good feedback on papers (not very timely though) and flexible with circumstances. Great intro to journalism; don't be intimated if you have no experience.,Terril Jones ,Government department,Mandatory,Yes

 GOV141,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Terril is the most hands-on teacher I've ever had. Classes are full of anecdotes from his 20+ years of experience as a journalist, amazing guest lecturers and the AP Stylebook.

If CMC does not hire him on in full capacity it will be a great loss for all students.",Terril Jones ,Government department,,
 GOV141,5.0,3.0,,,,No,Terril is one of the best teachers (refuses to be called a professor) I've had in my educational career. He's truly willing to go above and beyond for his students.

 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"FWS American Dreams with Prof Crockett was very manageable, though she did say that she was more lenient since it was an online class during Covid.

Workload is not bad at all.",Christine Crockett ,Literature department,Mandatory,Yes
 FWS010,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Professor Crockett is very caring and understanding, on top of being extremely helpful and passionate about helping her students learn and grow.

 ECON050,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"Prof. Olfati is probably the best professor I have had in College. She teaches almost entirely through lectures that are well developed, easy to understand, and are structured in a way that is easy to take notes. There are VERY easy tests every week that she warns you exactly what will be on all test, midterms and finals. Best econ proffesor!",Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,Drop/Withdrawal,Yes,"Love Professor Olfati - she's very nice. I have heard she has gotten more difficult lately. I found her tests and problem sets to be difficult, but I do not believe that was due to an issue with her teaching. The class is very lecture heavy - zoning out for a minute or two can be fatal. What she requires is reasonable. Econ at CMC is generally hard",Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"This class was fairly straightforward, but since 3 non-cumulative exams were each 30% of your grade, messing up on an exam would cost you a lot. Like in Econ 50, Olfati tells you exactly what questions will be on the exams, so as long as you know how to do those, you will do very well. There are literally zero curveballs. She is also funny!",Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Mandatory,Yes
 ECON050,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I found her class pretty easy. We had lectures, a very thorough review session before each exam (she tells you what short answer questions will be on the exam & the numbers are different but the question is exactly the same), and some really easy quizzes over definitions. Although the class was very easy, I learned a lot and would recommend her!",Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Mandatory,Yes
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B-,Yes,"Professor Olfati is great, you can tell she is a mom because she is very caring. She is understanding and accommodating but her Econ 101 tests were very difficult (it was hard to finish all of the questions under the time constraint). She explains exam content really well and prepares you well for exams. I would definitely take her class again.",Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON050,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Very easy intro economics class. Not a lot of work and the tests are really straightforward, basically just the problem sets she gave but with different numbers. Prof. Olfati is also unintentionally funny but she does lecture in a monotonal voice. Easy A for econ GE",Saman Olfati ,Economics department,,
 ECON101,4.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"This class was by no means an easy Ayou have to work pretty hard and seeking extra support.

If you're an econ major looking to build fundamentals for future classes, definitely avoid.",Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"This class was definitely challenging. In order to do well, you need to do the reading, attend tutoring, and visit office hours.

 ECON50,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Extremely straightforward quizzes and tests. Do the suggested questions and you're guaranteed a 100 in every quiz. Midterms are easy enough if you study exactly what she tells you to and go by the checklist provided. Good class for a solid A and a good ECON50 foundation.,Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON50,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Saman is the best econ teacher- she very clearly details exactly what will be on the exams. The only other grading criteria are quizzes. She tells you which questions from the book might be on them so you just have to make sure you know how to do those same exact problems (to get the answers you have to go to tutoring but there are only 6 or so).,Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON050,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Very interesting class from which I learned a lot especially because I didn't have an Econ background. Olfati is funny and makes the material as interesting as possible but it is Econ and you can expect a few long boring problem sets in lectures. Very difficult to get an A because she insists only 95%+ receive A's and not 93%+. Quizzes are a breeze,Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON050,4.5,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Professor Olfati is a great professor and person! She is extremely helpful and taught the subject very thoroughly. Going in, I had no prior background in economics, but she really gave me a great overview. I got an A, but was on top of all the assignments, read ahead, and went to office hours. The midterms and final are a HUGE part of the grade.",Saman Olfati ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON50,3.5,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Didn't take her own subject too seriously, made the workload easy to handle, gave quizzes instead of homework, very clear about what was expected, tests were fair, she's quite funny during lecture.

 PHYS102,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Great prof! His class was one of the toughest I had to take for my major, but he made himself available outside of class for office hours and even set up additional workshops where we could do problems together/ask questions about the HW. Tests were tough, but cheat sheets were allowed.",James Wells ,Physics department,Not Mandatory,
 PHYS031,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I think Wells had a rough start to teaching and rubbed people the wrong way. I also think that people don't like physics and take it out on him. I honestly believe he was one of the best professors in the department. He gives lots of homework, but you end up really understanding physics out of it. I highly recommend him. He's a very good teacher.",James Wells ,Physics department,Not Mandatory,
 PHYS33,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,Very challenging class and requires a lot of outside class time. The lectures in class are very hard to follow and I spent most of the classes just waiting for the two hours to be over.

 PHYS33,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Wells really cared about his students and their understanding of the topic.

 PHYS033,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,"Professor Wells goes on rambling lectures, never answers questions, makes things more confusing than they should be, and will jump at every opportunity to talk about his horses. 3/2 majors, don't take physics with him!

 PHYS33,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,Yes,"honestly professor wells is such a great dude! he has good intentions and is willing to help whenever you need it. i learned most of this stuff outside of class with tutoring and office hours, and he is extremely helpful when you reach out. tests based off in class problems and homework! this class was definitely challenging though",James Wells ,Physics department,,
 PHYS33,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"How do I even begin? This class made me lose my will to live. His lectures consisted of him reading directly off his PowerPoint, & the lectures had no correlation to the material on the homework or the exams. He yelled at us for not knowing and understanding material. If you want to learn, you have to teach yourself. This class made me miserable.",James Wells ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHYS033L,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"What an awful introduction to college physics! In his defense, Professor Wells seems to be knowledgeable about the topics, but he cannot teach in the slightest.

Ugh.",James Wells ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHYS33,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"I have personally never had such an awful academic experience. This class shattered my love for physics.

 PHYS033L,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"The class content was not hard for a person who took Physics in High school but Professor Wells made it so tough. He doesn't put much emphasis on Quizzes and they are a bit easy. His Homeworks are long, tough. His midterms are very very tough. The good thing is that he curves the final grade, which makes people better grades than they expected.",James Wells ,Physics department,Not Mandatory,
 PHYS33,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,I did worse than I feel I should have considering I took two years pf physics in high school. Doesn't make intro physics very accessible and is unapproachable outside of class. There is tutoring which helps. Material overall wasn't covered very well in lecture and you basically have to study yourself using the book. Phys 34 is a way better class.,James Wells ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHY33,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,Yes,He doesn't care about you or your grade. get ready to hustle on your own or die trying,James Wells ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHYS33,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Passionate about physics? Like having a high GPA? ... prepare to have that ruined if you take a class with Wells.

Constantly acted like he wasn't passionate about his teaching or his students .",James Wells ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHYS033L,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"He made the class more difficult than it's supposed to be. Your grade for the class is basically your overall grade from midterms/final.

 PHYS33,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"It doesn't matter how much you love physics, if you take his class he will take that love and feed it to his horses. He is a mean man and a bad prof. He makes me sad.",James Wells ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHYS033,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"He is not as bad as everyone makes him out to be! Yes, he yelled at the class a few times, BUT I'm not going to lie, our class can be very disrespectful and rude. You do have to read from the textbook quite a bit, but he breaks up the sections so it is very manageable. He is also helpful in office hours. You get what you put in from this class.",James Wells ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHYS33,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Does not go over the material in class, you have to read and take a reading quizzes before each class. He asks the class questions on the reading during class and gets irritated easily. I learned everything through tutors and re-reading the text book. One positive is that the exams are fairly short and easy.",James Wells ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHYS035,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Best physics prof at Keck, hands down. Actually wants to see you succeed instead of weeding students out. Phys 35 content is not an easy class, but Setter goes slow and makes sure it makes sense. You do have to go to class in order to succeed here, though, because the material is confusing. His lectures are good. Nice guy",Kevin Setter ,Physics department,,
 PHYS033,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor Setter is the best instructor I have ever had. He is so welcoming about questions that I always had all the comfort in the world asking until I fully understood the topic.,Kevin Setter ,Physics department,Mandatory,Yes
 PHYS033,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"My favorite professor at CMC by far -- he was very extremely helpful in office hours, explained material with utmost clarity, and made sure to drill a topic in your head instead of mindlessly moving on. Make sure to participate and complete homeworks systematically and you'll perform very well in the class!",Kevin Setter ,Physics department,Mandatory,
 PHYS035,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Great online teaching, lectures are clear and interesting, relevant to homework, answers questions well. Very accessible outside of class (office hours, email, Slack channel), worth it to attend office hours as homeworks are long and sometimes difficult. I learned a lot, even though the class was online this semester.",Kevin Setter ,Physics department,Mandatory,Yes
 PHYS35,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Professor Setter is kind, genuine, and clearly excited about what he teaches (physics). I highly recommend his class to anyone who is interested in physics. Be prepared, his class will challenge you, particularly homework assignments! However, exams are very fair and he is lenient with partial credit.",Kevin Setter ,Physics department,Mandatory,Yes
 PHYS031,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Setter is a solid choice for phys30/31. It's clear he loves physics and wants you to understand it and likes questions. Sometimes lecture isn't the most helpful bc we spend so long on one example or deriving formulas but the content was mostly relevant. Written and online HW every week with corrections and exams are fair (w corrections too).,Kevin Setter ,Physics department,Mandatory,

 PHYS34,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Took him because there weren't any other alternatives. Pleasantly surprised. Interesting guy, very VERY organised, lectures are most definitely rehearsed.

 PHYS33,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"On most test questions you will need to give a free body diagram, have your coordinates right etc. to receive full credit. DO IT!

 PHYS034,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Very very organized.  Great teacher though extremely  difficult. Very helpful.  Gives lecture notes out, but for that reason does not give study guides.

 PHYS30,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Landsberg is hilarious in that he is so painfully organized.  He really knows what he's teaching and is very clear in explanations.

He's easily the best choice for phyics.",Adam Landsberg ,Physics department,,

Generally really fun and interesting topics. Shows the show Rome sometimes too!,shane Bjornlie ,History department,,
 FHS2010,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Overall a great classroom experience. While lectures were a little boring (depending on subject content) he is a helpful prof who general wants his students to invest themselves in the subject matter. Be prepared to read a lot but if you forget listen in class. He is one of the most knowledgeable people I know.,shane Bjornlie ,History department,,
 FHS010,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Nice guy, wants to help his students, but tends to assign a lot of reading - know how to scan. Class is a good balance btw discussion and lecture - he has a great amt of background knowledge that supplements readings well. Essays, when graded, were fairly easy in my experience, but that was probably because this was an entry-level writing class.",shane Bjornlie ,History department,,
 HIST103,5.0,5.0,,,,No,"Bjornlie is such a nice guy. He goes out of his way to help you with anything, and really cares about his students. He assigns tons of reading, all of which is good, but you will be graded on some of it. Papers are seldom, but graded fairly hard",shane Bjornlie ,History department,,
 FHS010,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Excellent professor. Very engaging and he know's his material extremely well. He is a fair grader and he will go above and beyond to work with you in office hours. Not very many graded assignments, but quite a bit of reading.",shane Bjornlie ,History department,,
 HIST101,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,I have taken several classes with Prof. Bjornlie and I really love his teaching style. A good combination of lecture and discussion. You must come prepared to class and put thought into your papers. Not all of his classes have tests.,shane Bjornlie ,History department,,
 FWS10,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Moffett was my favorite teacher this semester. I learned so much in his class, the assignments were relevant and fun. Would 100% take his class again, would recommend all freshmen to take this given the chance. He is also very casually funny which always makes class interesting. A great person overall.",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department,,
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Class discussions on readings are engaging if you get involved. Really helps to improve your writing, if you put the work in. Interesting and varied prompts for papers.",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT038,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Amazing fiction writing professor who helped me significantly improve my own work. He was completely unpretentious and collaborative during our workshops, and made suggestions to my writing as a peer rather than an instructor, which was amazing because he is a successful and established writer himself.",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS030,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Moffett is amazing. His class is not only interesting, but he really taught me to be a better writer this semester. The reading was usually way overkill, and he does grade pretty hard but not unreasonably. The class is heavily weighed on participation, which is fine bcuz the class discussions are usually interesting. Overall, would 100% recommend.",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS10,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Really good guy and a great person to just talk to. He's a really caring person too, and will reward you if you're showing growth in your writings. Definitely not an easy ""A"" class, but if you put in the work, it's possible! He helps you bring out your creativity and immerses you in this seemingly mundane, yet intricate and vastly interesting topic",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS10,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Love this professor. You definitely have to possess some skill in writing ignorer to get a good grade, but Moffett is definitely willing to help you get better if you make the effort and ask.",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Respected and published professor who knows what he's doing. Course work for FWS Post Apocalyptic Narratives was not bad. Two major papers, three short responses, one short story. Do not expect to get better at writing unless you put in the work by meeting with him at office hours. Need to be a good writer to get a grade. Not much writing help",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department,,
 PHIL032,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,N/A,"Rajczi is a king. He will be one of those people I will be thinking about for the rest of my life. His classes were very engaging, discussion/thinking oriented.

Reasonable but still challenges his students, this class is a gem.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL032,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,No,"Very accessible outside of class and will talk to you about the material if you have any questions about it. That being said, it's very hard to nail down what it is exactly he wants from students (which is strange, because he's simultaneously very critical). This makes a lot of his grading feel somewhat arbitrary.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL032,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Rajczi is an awesome professor and an awesome guy. He's deeply empathetic for student concerns and is always willing to take feedback. When he sees a student idea, he takes the time to consider if the student has noticed something he hasn't and will change his ideas accordingly. The primer is a godsend and will 100% boost your grade in the class",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,Yes
 PHIL032,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Best class I've taken at CMC. Convinced me to become a Phil major. The professor explains the material in a very organized and methodical way that helps you understand it entirely, even though the subject is difficult. Class is mostly discussion and activity based which made it really fun. Especially great for someone who's never taken phil before.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,Yes
 PHIL039,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"I really enjoyed Professor Rajzci's class. He cares about student input.

I recommend taking his class, especially if you need the GE.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL177,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"This is simply not the guy you want if you actually care about the broader implications of the subject. He is inept to think beyond his narrow construction of ethics and morality which is HEAVILY centered in an exhausting CMC, Westernized style of learning and global understanding. Sooo disappointing given the subject of the class (warfare ethics)",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL165,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Rajczi is worth taking. Class discussion is well-led for the most part, subject matter is interesting, and the man is cuttingly bright. He can have a restrained temper if people get too unruly. PAPERS REALLY TAKE YOU TO TASK: you have to prepare them well in advance and get feedback in office hours to do well, as he grades them toughly.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL34,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"Rajczi is an awesome choice for a philosophy prof. Since you're probably going to need to take at least one philosophy class in college, and every class you take is going to have a huge lecture component, you should choose the one that's most interesting in class, and that's definitely Rajczi. Whenever you get lost, his office hours are helpful.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL37,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Someone told me Rajczi was the ""philosophy Buddha,"" and I can't disagree. His knowledge of his topic is impressive, but he really shines in how he relates to his students inside and outside of class. Discussions are engaging and provoking, like the readings. Outside of class, he organizes events like hikes and jam sessions to know his students.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL198,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"He is hands down my favorite professor. I've taken three classes with him, soon to be four. He makes difficult material easy to understand and is always available to speak in office hours. He's also really funny!

 PHIL34,4.0,4.0,Yes,,,No,Professor Rajczi almost turned me into a Philosophy major. His class is really interesting and looks at modern day philosophical issues. He's a tough grader but go to office hours! ,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,

 PHIL34,5.0,2.0,,,,No,Best professor at CMC. Super funny. Keeps class really interesting. The subject matter is great. He's reasonable and assigns the perfect amount of reading. Best feedback on papers I've ever received. Made me consider majoring in philosophy. People say he can be a bit condescending but he really isn't. Take his class!!!! You won't regret it.,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PRINCOFPHIL,3.5,4.0,,,,No,I actually really liked this class and I think he genuinely made me a smarter person. The workload isn't bad- you write a one page paper each class but it's usually just a reflection and he doesn't want you to take more than 30 mins on it. Plus 3-4 major papers. Taught me a lot. And go to class to discuss or else you won't get participation points!,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,3.0,3.0,,,,No,Worst class at CMC. Rajczi is VERY patronizing and controlling. Hated every minute of it.,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Favorite course and professor by far this semester! He chooses modern and stimulating topics like religion, robots, and happiness.

Highly recommended!",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL33H,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Really enjoyed his class, Political Phil Honors. Super interesting class, interesting prof too! Learned how to write really good phil papers.  Hard grader, tough curve.  Don't take his class if you won't attend, he can be nit picky--with things other than attendance too.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL033,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"I took his political philosophy class, which was really interesting. It is a good foundation for thinking and writing in a rational way, and actually helped me with my papers for other classes. The class is based on two papers, so if that will stress you out, don't take the class. Also, the grading can seem sort of arbitrary and he's a hard grader.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL1,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Professor Rajczi's class was filled with ungraded busywork which you were penalized for not doing and boring discussions over pointless minutia.  My least favorite class I've ever taken at CMC or even in high school.  I learned nothing about philosophy.,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL1,4.0,5.0,,,,No,His class is the best I have taken at CMC. He is thought provoking and wants his students to explore the issues raised and to further understand their own beliefs and opinions. He produces good philosophers.,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL165,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Don't take his classes.  He gets stuck on a few arguments and doesn't even really cover them that well.  Also an insane grader.  He says no page limit, but really he wants 20 or more double spaced.  You won't benefit and most likely it'll hurt your GPA.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL92,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Hilarious guy and keeps class interesting.  Facilitated and directed discussions well and allowed us to turn in our paper a second time to get a higher grade.  Plans activities outside of class like jug band night at his house :),Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL183,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"This professor changed the way I think about learning for the better. The skills you learn in his class will transfer over to all other disciplines. He is extremely helpful outside of class and genuinely cares about the learning experience for the student. Listen to him carefully, he is very wise and candid.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL92,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Not a lot of busy work, but a lot of effort is expected from students. You probably will get a lower grade than you usually do, but the class will be a deep learning experience.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,

 PHIL92,5.0,3.0,,,,,"Racjzi is a great guy and very funny. He makes his classes interesting.  Not challenging enough yet, but his assignments will make you think. Go to office hours with him!  He's very accessible (even gives you his home phone number).",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL159,5.0,3.0,,,,,"This guy is really accessible - make sure to take advantage of the fact that he invites students to lunch and the Ath. He may seem intimidating and a difficult grader at first, he's a really caring and helpful guy who goes the extra mile to help motivated students.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL90,4.5,2.0,,,,,"He was pretty easy.  I found him pretty fair in his expectations (I never read anything after the first two weeks and got B's on my papers), but I do feel that he was sort of cold; he made me feel pretty uncomfortable overall whenever I answered questions.  He's not too bad, though.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department,,
 PSYC40,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Tough, tough, tough grader and class. Really makes you work for that A, requires significant participation, and the exams are very difficult (hardest I've had at CMC).

 PSYCH040,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"She is an incredibly difficult professor, but teaches very well. I spent on average 1-2 hours in her office every single week for the last half of the semester and barely got an A in the class. Go to office hours if you want to do well.

 PSYC040,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Umanath's cognitive psychology class. She is super enthusiastic about the subject and makes class interesting and fun.

 PSYC040,4.0,4.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"The material of the cognitive class is interesting and the class is organised. But her grading is unnecessarily hard, and all midterms are cummulative.

 PSYC164,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Taking Umanath was a horrible experience. For full participation credit u have to speak at least 3 times a class, in addition to posting 3 discussion questions and 1 discussion response each night. +if you don't say exactly what she wants to hear, u don't get full credit. & despite being a psych, her discussions/acitivities were SUPER triggering",Sharda Umanath ,Psychology department,Mandatory,
 PSYCH164,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I love Professor Umanath. Took her autobiographical memory class and she is top of the top. She knows her stuff and is so passionate about it.

 GOV70H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Taw is what I came to CMC for. She's an incredibly knowledgeable professor, which sometimes leads her to lecture quite quickly, but I've learned an insane amount from her.

 CHEM14,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,Prow Huynh is great but chem14 in Keck is horrible especially with the flipped classroom curriculum.

 CHEM14,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,"Contradicts himself in lecture, does not use book and has his own website with explanations. Exams are impossibly graded.

He shares his passion for literature every day!",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS1,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Very knowledgeable. It is possible to get an A, but you must work for it. He always opens up extra office hours and is very helpful.

 FWS1,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"If you want to become a better writer, take Prof. Warner. His feedback can feel nit-picky, but it is always specific and helpful. He invests time in his students.

 LIT119,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Warner is tough and very critical of writing at the sentence level. Some might call him nitpicky, but I think it does help improve your writing.

 FWS1,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"He goes out of his way to make the subject interesting and make himself available outside of class. You really have to work for an A, but when you do, you learn a lot.

He is one of my favorite professors!,Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Warner is a great teacher! In highschool, I hated every lit class and every book we read, but he made the classes interesting.

 LIT10,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Warner is a captivating lecturer, very clear about the class and requirements, and really  makes it hard NOT to see him outside of class to help with your writing. He is indeed a tough grader but it's reasonably fair since he is upfront about raising the bar.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 LIT163,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"""Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""  I was disappointed with his leadership class.  He claims to be a tough grader - but what that really means is 1 it isn't clear what he wants 2 the class is structured so it's hard to improve.  You only have one or two assignments of each type - so by the time you know what he wants, it's too late.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 LIT163,2.5,4.0,,,,No,"While I understand that Professor Warner is great in some of his other classes, he was only marginally good in Leadership in Lit. and Film. He didn't seem to understand it very well.  I think this is because leadership is his hobby, while the other classes that he teaches reflect his professional interests. Probably is good for other classes though",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 LITANDWAR,5.0,3.0,,,,,"I asked my friends for an amazing professor from any department at the 5Cs and 5 people indedendently recommended him- I'll take his class again, no matter what the topic- you learn so much and he's so dynamic.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 LIT162,4.5,5.0,,,,,Absolutely brilliant. Expect to be challenged but don't go in expecting an A  - you probably won't get one. A totally worthwhile class.,Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 CRITICALTHINK,5.0,4.0,,,,,I was Pitzer student but I decided to take one of his classes anyway. He was very demanding but it was worth it. His lectures were so compelling and thought provoking that I hated to miss. He once gave me an awesome write up of one of my assignments that I still have posted in my office today. I good grade from him means something. Smokn hot too!,Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 RUSLITBRITLIT,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Awesome man, great heart. Didn't always agree with the guy, though, but that's alright, he is the professor. He was my thesis reader and told it to me straight.

 LIT10,4.5,4.0,,,,,"He will give you a B- or B, if you are lucky, if you write a good paper but do not go see him about it. You will NOT get an A unless you go discuss your paper with him beforehand.  He an AMAZING lecturer.  He is captivating and BRILLIANT, but not the most fair grader.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 LIT10,4.5,3.0,,,,,"The only way to get an A on a paper is to go out of your way and meet with him to discuss it.  He's very willing to make time to meet with you though.  The workload is pretty light, and the class is a lot of discussion, but again, meet with him for the A",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department,,
 ECON050,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,He's so cool. He is very generous with tests and they are kinda easy if you know the material (he doesn't try to trick you). Doesn't answer emails which is annoying but always has office hours. I recommend,Philip Luck ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON050,3.0,2.0,,No,A+,Yes,"Professor Luck cares a lot about his students, but sometimes it just gets ridiculous. For instance, he agrees with basically anything that a student might say and then tries to steer them in a right direction, but that is just confusing. His lectures are mostly boring, but otherwise he is a good professor who genuinely tries to make Econ engaging.",Philip Luck ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON050,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Love prof luck!!! Cares about students and super clear, engaging lecturer. Participation is not graded but lecture style is a back and forth with students.

Progressive approach to grading provides ample extra credit, does not cap # of ppl w As",Philip Luck ,Economics department,,
 FWS010,1.0,5.0,Yes,,A-,N/A,"She is a horrible FWS professor. Instead of genuinely helping students improve their writing, she drills us on rigid essay structure and leaves no room for creativity. I felt like I had become a worse writer after her class. Class readings were interesting however, writing papers was absolutely miserable. Constantly felt discouraged in class!",Megan Gallagher ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Hard grader but easy to do well in the end.,Megan Gallagher ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"She grades super tough and also forces students to write in support of things like the existence of patriarchy. I believe patriarchy does exist to an extent, but to force students to write a paper supporting the existence of it goes against my instincts of respect for other people's perspectives on the world. My classmates felt uncomfy about it....",Megan Gallagher ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,3.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I took Professor Gallagher's Post-Apocalyptic Humanity FWS course despite hearing negative things from other people. I actually really enjoyed the readings (one being a comic book) and thought that they all worked well together. Discussions were awkward since it was a small class and her grading is definitely very tough, but overall it wasn't bad.",Megan Gallagher ,Literature department,Mandatory,Yes
 FHS010,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,Most painful class I've ever taken. Most end up with fine grades but the stress is not worth it. Gives horrible grades on early essays then better grades at the end to make you think you've become a better writer when you've probably gotten worse. Tells you your ideas are bad if they don't match hers. Her writing advice won't fly in any other class,Megan Gallagher ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 PHIL034,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Your grade is 40% weekly homework, which is easy to score high on. This cushions the grades for more difficult assignments like the final two essays (2000 words each). You should do well on the essays if you go to office hours and basically just reiterate what the text and the prof say. He's a super good prof so discussions were always interesting!",Joseph Frigault ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL034,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,Great professor and interesting class. Readings can be a bit long but they are interesting and worth reading. There are reading responses which consist of about 10-12 sentences regarding the reading and they are due the day before your class at 2 pm which can be a bit inconvenient. Other than that great class!,Joseph Frigault ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL034,4.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Kind, genuine professor who gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit. Readings are contemporary and applicable to modern day society, which is especially handy considering ""moral and political issues."" Only drawback is he assigns reading responses for every class due in the middle of the day, the day before class- so it's fairly inconvenient",Joseph Frigault ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL034,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Frigault is super interesting and he made our 8am worth getting up for. Before each class, you have a 10-20 page reading and you answer 4 questions (2-3 sentences each) about what you found interesting + questions you have about the reading. The class is discussion-based so there are lots of opportunities to participate. Definitely recommend!",Joseph Frigault ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Love Professor Rentz! Such a sweet, caring professor. Very willing to meet you during office hours and accommodate you during the semester.

Love the reading material and make class discussions very inclusive.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Love her! She's the sweetest prof and you can tell that she loves what she teaches.

There's a reading before every class, and you have to submit 400 words every week.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,,
 LIT063,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Literally one of the most (if not THE most!!) kindest, caring professors at CMC.

 LIT57,5.0,3.0,,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Rentz is such a lovely person. She truly cares about her students and reassesses the class workload based on student feedback.

Her enthusiasm really rubs off on students and assignments are fun and doable",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,Mandatory,Yes
 LIT111,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,I think the class could have gone a little deeper and she could have connected a little better with us. Classroom environment felt a little fake and cold,Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT105,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Great prof! The first time Professor Rentz read Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in Middle English, all the students were completely mesmerized.

 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Took Monsters FWS. FWS is a course really nobody wants to take but you have to. That being said, she made the content interesting and I genuinely feel like my writing improved. Not too much workload (30-40 pages per class) and 3-4 medium length papers throughout the semester. She is super nice, understanding, and cares about you.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Took her for my FWS on Monsters. Great professor, she cares about you as a student as a person.

Manageable workload, but be ready to write about a page for every class plus reading.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT110,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I love medieval lit because of Prof Rentz; she proposes nuanced, insightful interpretations of readings and thoughtfully considers contributions to the discussion. Assigned a reasonable amount of reading, a few essays, several brief quizzes. She is a feminist and applies these ideas to the chivalric romance in really interesting ways. Recommended!",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,,
 LIT110,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Ellen Rentz is wonderful; she can occasionally get frustrated with students but the frustration clearly comes from a place of high expectations and respect and most of the time she is incredibly  kind. Reading is very manageable, grading on essays is not hard, and lectures are very fun, she makes long class periods pass very quickly. Take her class",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT66,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A+,Yes,"Took her Shakespeare's Comedies class. We went through a play every two weeks or so, with a small amount of writing after each and a few bigger projects.

 FWS10,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"A very nice woman who's class was interesting at times, but was often dull. Her grading is harsh and wants her writing in a specific style. However, she is always available for help when you need her! She's better suited for an upper-level English class, rather than FWS. If you're a strong writer, take her.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,,
 FWS010,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,She's a really invested professor and really helpful when it comes to writing. She cares about her students and picked good readings. I would definitely recommend her class. She values participation in discussion very highly,Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,,
 LIT063,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Chaucer. Took for a GE and it was actually a very enjoyable class. Loved Professor Rentz. She was a total sweetheart and was very helpful in office hours. Only two papers 5-7 pages, homework, and a research guide made up the grade. Not a whole lot of reading but that was counterbalanced by the fact it was all in middle english.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,,
 FWS10,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,She was okay.  Definatly favors the brOwn nosers and hated most of the men in the class.  Feminist. Really helpful when writing essays though.,Ellen Rentz ,Literature department,,
 LIT105,5.0,2.0,,,,No,"Rentz is an unbelievably wonderful professor. She's adorable, yes, but more importantly- she's a fantastic teacher.

 CHEM014,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor P-R is one of the best I had this semester! She's really inspiring and makes herself very available to students.

The flipped classroom model is not ideal but she made it bearable & explained things well. Offers extra credit!!!,Kathleen Purvis-Roberts ,Chemistry department,Not Mandatory,
 CHEM29,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Purvis-Roberts is one of the most caring and overall nicest professors I have ever had. She genuinely wants to see her students succeed and is great in office hours.

 CHEM15,5.0,2.0,,,,No,"Very nice and clear throughout lectures. Her tests are challenging, but they are very fair. Didn't use textbook much apart from problem sets.

 PSYC081,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"She is VERY caring for her students! She cut homework, made 1 paper optional & let us have a notecard on exams.

 PSYC030,4.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"Do not take this course if you are a science major looking to fulfill a GE!

 PSYC030,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"If you are a psych major and have time to study, take her! You will learn so much! But I would avoid if you are just taking for  GE.

 PSYCH030,4.0,1.0,Yes,,A,Yes,Prof Stacey's intro to Psych class is clearly one of the best classes I have taken. Though she is a touch grader she expects her students to learn as much as possible.

I would recommend this class to all those people who are sincerely interested in learning,Stacey Doan ,Psychology department,,
 PSYC030,2.5,4.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"Her intro to psyc is not an easy class.  This course can teach you a lot if you put in the effort, but is too hard for an intro class.

She also constantly tests us on information that is covered in neither the review sheet nor the lecture.",Stacey Doan ,Psychology department,Mandatory,
 PSYCH30,1.0,5.0,Yes,,B+,No,Nothing about intro to psych in this class. Whole bunch of videos and her own research articles. Not what was required for intro to psych. Waste of time.

Run dude, run!",Stacey Doan ,Psychology department,Mandatory,
 PSYCH30,5.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"The class is quite difficult. As a Science student I would put the workload slightly below that of an into science course, however, it is also an amazingly immersive class where if you put the effort in, you can learn a lot.

 PSYC030,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I think people don't like it because it's not an easy class. But if you put in the effort, you will learn a lot. She also curves the final grades! She uses video clips, to make class entertaining, and posts slides.",Stacey Doan ,Psychology department,Mandatory,

 CSCI040,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,This class is tough but very worth it! All the projects are interesting and not just theory-based.

Lots of extra credit opportunities. Mike is incredibly knowledgeable and kind! :),Michael Izbicki ,Computer Science department,Not Mandatory,
 CSC040,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,This course is difficult- don't get me wrong. But it would probably be easier than equivalent courses offered at HMC or Pomona. Our assignments helped build out our Github while being useful/practical. Mike clearly states that it will take 12 - 15 hours of work a week for an A- and that's pretty accurate. Put in the work and go to tutoring!!,Michael Izbicki ,Computer Science department,Not Mandatory,
 CSCI040,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,"Don't take CS40 as your Math GE. It is not an intro class, you need heavy coding knowledge.

 CSCI040,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Prof Izbicki is a great guy, and you'll learn a lot from his class. It's not an easy A, and you'll have to put in the hours to do well on quizzes and the assignments.

I'd definitely recommend this class; you'll take away a lot of great skills.",Michael Izbicki ,Computer Science department,Mandatory,
 CSCI040,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I like Mike. He is chill and the labs and homework are fun and useful. You might have a harder time if you never took CS before, but if you have some knowledge and you can teach yourself sometimes Mike is a great choice. He gives a lot of extra credit options.

 MATH166,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A+,No,"First portion of the semester was all theory and abstract CS/Math, while the second portion was all about implementation.

 CSCI181,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A+,No,"One of my favorite classes I have taken during all of College. Heavy emphasis on learning through projects and assignments.

 CSC42,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Disorganized lectures, midway through the semester after a midterm realized how little content I have learned from the course.

 SPAN44,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,Didnt give clear rubrics and instructions but graded hard with little explanation as to how to improve. Not accessible at all and class was very intimidating.

She makes an effort to show that she cares about her students by being flexible with deadlines and taking the class out to dinner. Highly recommended.",Gabbrielle Johnson ,Philosophy department,Not Mandatory,
 PHIL135,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Professor Johnson is easily the sharpest professor in the CMC philosophy department. At least in her upper level classes, she is a very tricky grader and will make it very difficult to get an A. If you're interested in the content she teaches, she's a must-have professor. If not, her grading criteria will seem arbitrary and excessively difficult.",Gabbrielle Johnson ,Philosophy department,Not Mandatory,
 PHIL39,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,Prof Johnson is amazing. She is very smart and knowledgeable in her area of expertise. She makes the class very interesting and fun.

 PHIL135,5.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,"Be advised, while Professor Johnson is a great professor who is clearly knowledgeable about her stuff, she is an extremely tough grader. Grades seem somewhat arbitrary.

 PHIL100A,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"She's tough but very nice and she guides class discussions well so that they never feel stale while still giving everyone a chance to contribute.

 PHIL030,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Lots of reading, good deal of writing, active participation in class is expected. This class will make you actively engage with and think about and debate the philosophical texts you're given. Excellent introduction to the field imo; it did feel like we were doing philosophy instead of merely reading it.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL030,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,No,"VERY RIGID. I wouldn't recommend unless you're well read in philosophy. She seems to have a one track mind for right and wrong answers, and is not open to philosophical interpretations. She also doesn't give much to explain or help with understanding and seems to push harder when a topic is difficult. She is not nurturing, and not very open.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,Yes
 PHIL030,4.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,Super fun and engaging professor. Makes every lecture super fun and interesting. But VERY HARD grader. You need to put in serious work to do well.,Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,Yes

Excellent professor!!",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL030,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Lots of work in weekly readings & essays, but they are interesting. If you do the work and follow the instructions, class is not very difficult.

Overall this is an interesting course for intro phil.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,Not Mandatory,
 PHIL030,4.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"This class pushed me in the best way possible. The class is hard, but Prof. O helps you become an incredible writer.

She is a really tough grader but the class is so worth it.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,

 PHIL030,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Intro Phil. is A LOT of work, but it pays off. She makes you love philosophy, and really engages her students.

 PHIL030,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"The class is very intellectually challenging, yet extremely rewarding. Discussions were engaging, material was interesting, and lectures were clear.

She challenges students to think for themselves.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL030,5.0,3.0,,,A-,Yes,Professor O's class literarily is the class that makes me fall in love with philosophy. She is very helpful and engaging. The structure of the lecture is extremely clear.

 PHIL100A,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor O is the most amazing professor I have ever had.  She really knows her stuff, and she keeps class engaging and clear.

This class will change your life, and Professor O is brilliant.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,,
 FHS10,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"VERY Strict about attendence!  If you want a slacker class, this is not it.

Prof. O keeps it dynamic in the classroom, too, with some of the best discussions I have ever had in my academic life.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL101A,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Amazing! One of the best professors I've ever had. She inspired me to become a philosophy major. Prof. O. expects a lot from her students, but gives a lot in return. Don't take her ancient phil classes if you want to slack off.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL090H,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Professor Obdrzalek is helpful and entertaining.  She has high standards for her students.

Without question, she goes above beyond the requirements of her job.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL90H,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor O's Honours Intro class will make or break you as a philosopher.

 PHIL90H,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"My favorite class in my first semester.  There's great class discussion.  I've had the most contact with Prof. O out of all my professors: she has lunches with us, meets us to look at outlines for essays, or makes time to meet if we don't understand something.  The class is a lot of fun.  I've learned to build strong arguments.  Yay for philosophy!",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL90H,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Obdrzalek is an absolutely amazing professor. She is wicked smart and very demanding, but she geniunely cares about the sucess of her students.

 PHIL90H,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Despite her last name being impossible to pronounce, Professor O is amazing!  She's incredibly smart and loves talking to students.

I would recommend this class to no one, ever, under any circumstances.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL1,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She teaches what is definitely the most difficult intro philosophy course on campus, but it is probably also the most rewarding.  She demands a lot from her students, but it is only because she really wants you to learn.  She is very helpful in office hours and is a fun person to talk to outside of class.  Not an easy grader, but a fair one.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL112,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"I think you either love her style or hate it.  I loved it.  I think that it is genuinly one of the best philosophy classes I have taken.

 PHIL90,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"Talks very very fast. Bring your laptop to class if you wish to get anything out of your notes. Abrupt personality, sometimes even mean.

If you're struggling, she's really accessible during office hours.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,Yes
 PHIL030,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,Took an intro phil class with Professor Kind and it was decently engaging. The paper prompts were pretty difficult so I wish more time was spent teaching how to write a philosophy paper.

 PHIL95,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Kind knows her stuff, and is great at teaching it. The unfortunate thing is it seems people either get logic or they don't.

 PHIL126,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"She front-loads her Metaphysics class to have some really difficult concepts at the beginning, but if you persist the class is really interesting overall. You have 9 papers (800-1000 words each), 1 group project @ end of semester. Grading is fair but not too tough, and she really loves the subject which makes class great to attend.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department,,
 FHS105,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Kind's FHS class (Life, death, and meaning) is amazing. If you like philosophy at all this is a great class to take.

The class has a lot of reading and 3 difficult essays, so its a bit of work.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department,,
 FHS10,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Professor Kind made me really come to love philosophy and helped me learn to think in a new way. She is easily the best prof I've had at CMC. Definitely take her class,Amy Kind ,Philosophy department,,

 FHS01,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Great facilitator of discussions. It's easy to get away with not doing the readings, but they are pretty interesting and you'll get a lot more out of the class by doing them.

 PHIL90H,3.5,2.0,,,,,"She doesn't care what you think.  She just wants you to agree with her.  This goes for class discussion and papers and it is ****ing annoying.

 LOGIC,5.0,4.0,,,,,"She was funny and very competent. The work was difficult, but I never felt overloaded with homework. She didn't take crap from the annoying, overly-confident boys in the class. Her tests are challenging, but she has really helpful study sessions before them all.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department,,
 LOGIC,4.5,4.0,,,,,"She made this otherwise complex subject pretty easy and even interesting. Her class is what introduced me to Philosophy, and now I am majoring in it. That says a lot.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department,,
 MATH111,4.0,3.0,Yes,,Incomplete,Yes,(This is for Math 165) The entire class is lectures with low amounts of student participation. She provides thorough lecture notes with searchable text. The homework is more tedious than difficult but I think that might just be the nature of numerical analysis. There were three midterms but she grades generously and offers correction opportunities.,Chiu-Yen Kao ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 MATH060C,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Kao showed a ton of compassion during the online semester. She always made herself available outside of class and her usual office hours, offering students the chance to submit test corrections as well. If you're looking to learn Linear Algebra without the stress of not knowing whether you can get an A, I would take Prof Kao's class.",Chiu-Yen Kao ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,Yes
 MATH060C,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Kao is great. While remote, she held multiple office hours every week to help with homework, and was super accessible outside of class.

Cons- hard to understand at times.",Chiu-Yen Kao ,Mathematics department,,Yes

 MATH032,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,I like that she is available to students and tries to be understanding and accommodating! But the class was not engaging and I didn't end up learning very much because the class didn't make me want to work for it. She has an agenda that she doesn't want to stray from so we often went ahead in the syllabus despite feeling lost.,Chiu-Yen Kao ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 MATH111,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor Kao is very helpful in and out of the classroom. Her differential equation class is lecture-based but she will try to get everyone to answer questions and get involved. She gives detailed explanations to theorems and definitions and she is open to questions. Homework is a lot and tough but pretty helpful. Definitely will take again!,Chiu-Yen Kao ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 MATH31,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Her lectures are not very clear and she is not good at explaining problems. Homework is assigned for every class and it is graded. She emphasizes learning definitions of concepts and tedious proofs, which are very unnecessary. However, she is accessible outside of class and tries to accommodate students. Tests questions are similar to hw problems.",Chiu-Yen Kao ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 PHIL158,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,Yes,"It was a bit weird taking Prof Martin's class as one of my first upper div phil classes, as the syllabus is very structured and rigid in terms of what students can talk about. She'll often guide discussion in a very narrow direction, or will let students ramble on tangents that make it hard to engage. She cares, but I rarely got timely feedback.",Adrienne Martin ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL158,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,No,"Her class doesn't really feel like a philosophy class. She's overly formulaic and she generally expects you to interpret things the same way that she does.

 PHIL100E,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Very thoughtful person who pushed me to become a better thinker and a more competent philosophy student.

 METAPHYSICS1,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Hardest Phil class I have taken to date. Krienes really pushes you for your best, and expects a lot from his students.

Made me think a lot about my own beliefs.",James Kreines ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I have nothing but positive things to say about Professor Kreines.

Especially if you're interested in philosophy, he's probably the best professor you'll have.",James Kreines ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Kreines is the best professor I have ever had. He made me fall in love with Philosophy. I am in my second class with him and can't recommend him enough. There are two papers and two exams per semester and his goal is to help you write the best papers you can and learn as much as you can. Not easy but 100% worth it.,James Kreines ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL106,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I took FHS and Kant with Kreines, and I must say they are by far the best courses I've taken. Kreines not only teaches philosophy, but also hones the skills how to think in philosophy.

 PHIL106,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,"Truly brilliant scholar and fantastic at helping you make sense of the toughest pieces of philosophy.

 FHS01,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Can't imagine how inspirational this class is to my life!! The intellectual challenge encountered and the effort spent in the course materials will train you to become a better thinker, both academically and in life.

 PHIL30H,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Kreines is the best. I honestly can't stress this enough: take his class. He is challenging but understanding. So smart and chill.

 PHIL30H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,The most fun and interesting class this semester. I loved the discussions in and out of class with this professor and the rest of the class. The prof really appears to respect every student and takes all arguments very seriously.,James Kreines ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL30H,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Professor Kreines is awesome. He sincerely cares about you and your thoughts--he's the type of person to get at the content rather than focusing on how you frame it or other trivial things. I got excellent grades but there is so much more to his class than that. You get to see different perspectives and cool insights.,James Kreines ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"FAVORITE PROF I've had this semester. Such a brilliant prof and is so engaging. I looked forward to almost every single class and have never been so intellectually engaged and stimulated.

Would recommend to anyone.",James Kreines ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 FHS01,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Kreines is a good professor but not 10/10(!!!!!!!!).  Discussions are good & well-led.  Office hours can be a little confusing.

 PHIL127,4.0,4.0,Yes,,A,No,"He has high expectations for your work, but is more than willing to help you get there. He is super passionate about what he's teaching, and clearly brilliant.

 FHS,4.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor and super helpful during office hours. His class is a little confusing because he bounces around topics a lot.

Would definitely take his class!",James Kreines ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 FHS1,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"He was my favorite class for that semester.  His class discussions are challenging and that is where it pays off to pay attention, although you don't have to.  He has a good sense of humor and kept the class fun. The way he presents topics and talks about them often blew my mind about philosophy.  A great teacher to have.",James Kreines ,Philosophy department,,
 FHS01,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,HE IS AWESOME! I love Prof Kreines he really cares about his students and is such a great guy. He made me a better writer and I can argue my points with clarity now. Yes he could be hard but in the long run it is worth it because you can improve as a student with him. Take his class!,James Kreines ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL101,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Although I had not noticed while sitting in his class, early modern has changed the way I look at the world and has challenged the foundations of everything from knowledge to causality.

 PHIL30H,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Kreines is awesome! He's super smart, very fun and funny, and a great discussion leader. He expects a lot out of you, especially on essays, but he'll go over your drafts and edit them for you. You have to do the reading, but his class literally changed the way I look at the world.

 CHEM116L,2.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"If you're interested in pursuing a career in psychiatry, I HIGHLY recommend taking Orgo with Joel Mackey.  By the end of the class, you will have expertise in dealing with people with personality disorders.  ",Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM116,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"Professor Mackey kept with the flipped classroom, which I personally did not find very helpful - especially with how difficult OChem is already. In class, he was laid-back and he's always willing to answer questions about class material. However, the weekly quizzes and exams were fairly difficult. Be prepared to put in a few hours each day.",Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department,,
 CHEM116,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Professor Mackey is great! This semester, his class stayed as a flip classroom. This still worked for me because in person, you do a lot of word problems which makes the readings and videos clearer and gives you a sense of how exam questions will look. Hes also good at explaining things and actually has humor.",Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department,Not Mandatory,
 CHEM116,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,Mackey teaches by intimidation. He likes to present himself as an abstruse academic who understand things his students do not. I did not find his office hours very helpful or his teaching style effective.,Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department,,

 CHEM117,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"Mackey is a great choice for an o-chem prof. The class is hard, but that's mostly because of the material rather than his teaching style.

 CHEM116L,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Professor Mackey's could be a little clearer in lecture. Often he gives a lot of examples but doesn't really explain the grand scheme of things.

His tests are fair, but a lot of learning is done outside of class, as is expected with Organic Chemistry.",Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department,Mandatory,
 CHEM117,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Mackey's lectures can be soothing to the point of sleep, but he has great OH and is actually really funny. He pretty much just goes over the book which is too bad, but he knows his stuff. His exams are either easy or hard... rarely in the middle which is hard to predict! Solid choice for a professor.

 FHS010,1.0,2.0,,No,A-,No,"Professor Uvin is one of the worst professors I have ever had. His feedback is rude, unhelpful, and downright degrading.

 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Uvin (former Dean of Faculty which is why he has so few ratings) is amazing! It's about development. Participation, 2 short papers (very easy), a class that you plan (pretty easy), and a longer final paper (easy bc lots of time to do it).

 BIO143,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"If you read over the textbook before lecture, you should be fine. The problem sets are definitely challenging but if you go to office hours (she has multiple every week), you should be able to get 100 on every problem set.

It is not easy, but he is very helpful and a good prof overall.",Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department,Mandatory,Yes
 ECON50,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof. Fernholz is a fantastic professor. Econ50 is a class with 40+ people yet it never feels that big -- he will always take the time to get to know you and help you.

 HIST120,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Livesay is extremely kind and responds positively to even the slightest extra effort by you.  His lectures are interesting, and he definitely notices participation.  Sometimes his grading was a bit unclear, but he is willing to go above and beyond to help you reach your goals.",Daniel Livesay ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST114,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"He is very specific about what he wants in papers, and that generally includes a learning curve, but when you get the formula down it's not very difficult. Half the class is discussion based on the assigned reading and half of it is material he brings up in class. Great history prof and such a nice guy!",Daniel Livesay ,History department,Mandatory,
 HIST196,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I thoroughly enjoyed Prof Livesay's class. He picks some of the most interesting and relevant readings and effectively incorporates them in his lectures and discussions. His grading is fair, and he's always open/willing to help. As with all history classes, there's a lot of reading but you could get by just by skimming. Highly recommend.",Daniel Livesay ,History department,Mandatory,
 PSYC109,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,One of the worst teachers I've had. The class was mainly graded off of three extremely hard tests that had zero relation to what was taught. The test was 100x harder than the material that we covered. She also makes you do an insane amount of work outside of class. I do not recommend taking her for Stats at all! Not an intro-level course.,Jennifer Feitosa ,Psychology department,,
 PSYCH109,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,"Worst profesor Ive taken a class with at CMC. Unprofessional, condescending, and her teaching style is very lazy. She makes you watch videos on your own, with some hard concepts and then goes over it in class. The assignments are time consuming and barely even help your grade cuz 75% is based on three tests.",Jennifer Feitosa ,Psychology department,Mandatory,
 PSYC109,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Exams are tough and count for 75% of your grade, but Prof. Feitosa gives a lot of outside resources (TAs, QCL mentor, recorded lectures, extra assignments) that can be very helpful. She really wants you to succeed, but the exams count for way too much and are often graded pretty harshly.",Jennifer Feitosa ,Psychology department,Mandatory,
 PSYCH109,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Very hard class,Jennifer Feitosa ,Psychology department,Mandatory,
 PSYCH175,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Even though the class was online, Professor Feitosa made lectures engaging and also gave us an opportunity to get to know one another through fun activities. She does expect you to put in the work to earn the grade but is also readily available to help out in any way she can. Definitely recommend taking a class with her!",Jennifer Feitosa ,Psychology department,,Yes
 PSYC109,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Feitosa is amazing! If you study hard, you will definitely get the grade you deserved! She was very accessible outside of class, so was the TA. Highly, highly recommend!",Jennifer Feitosa ,Psychology department,Mandatory,Yes
 PHIL038,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Locke is definitely the teacher you want to take for Philosophy GE. Short readings with a one-question quiz every day. Barely any homework. Don't have to take any notes. Cool dude. I 100% recommended it. The class has zero stress.,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL038,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,He's a very likable and enjoyable professor. I would highly recommend! Really interesting readings that are also very manageable. There isn't too much homework.

He's a pretty tough grader but if you put the work in he will reward you.,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL038,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Readings every night, then a quiz on them in class. You have seven attempts to complete 4 writing assignments, all different. The class gets to choose their favorite philosophical topics to study in the second half of the semester. Most people get anywhere from an A to B-. Prof Locke is funny, gives great feedback, and loves to talk philosophy.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL038,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"If you're looking to fulfill your Philosophy GE while improving your analytical writing skills this is the class. Prof Locke's levels system really pushes you to become a concise, analytical writer. If you listen take detailed note of his feedback between every attempt, you'll be fine.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL038,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Locke's class had, by far, the most interesting readings of any course I have taken so far. If the idea of learning more about time travel or the free will debate interests you, take this course. He can be picky with writing assignments, but his goal is to make you a better analytical writer, not just let you coast through the class.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL30,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Dustin Locke was one of my favorite freshmen professors. I was very unsure about philosophy after some extremely boring high school classes, but I loved this class. I took his intro to reality and reason first semester and became a much better thinker, writer, and debater in that time. I recommend him to all my friends, and added him as an advisor",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL038,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"He grades on the level system so there are no midterms or finals, but the levels are definitely tricky and he can be very picky. The readings were SO interesting and I loved class discussions. If you go to his office hours he is very clear and it definitely helps! Overall a great prof with an amazing class but can be picky",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Not Mandatory,Yes
 PHIL038,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Locke was perfect for my phil GE. he's super nice, super helpful in office hours.

 PHIL038,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Locke is so passionate about the material he teaches and makes everyone else passionate about it too.

He lets the class decide what we are going to learn for the second half of class and we talked about really interesting things. Take his class",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL030,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,Prof. Locke is super chill and he is always eager to answer questions or help. I love the class based learning and discussions and he genuinely loves philosophy and this makes it so much easier and funner to learn the subject!,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL038,1.0,5.0,Yes,,A-,No,"I learned nothing in his class. Throughout, Locke was extremely unhelpful and seemed determined to make it as hard as possible for his students to do well. I have not yet encountered a worse professor, and I don't think I will.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL038,2.5,2.0,Yes,,,No,This class is to philosophy what some kids talking about reality after watching Interstellar is to Immanuel Kant. Take this class if you heard the word philosophy somewhere but have no idea what it means and want to learn more. Don't take this class if you've ever actually seriously thought about any issue (or would like to).,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL38,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Very fun class atmosphere. Lively discussion. Locke is very unique, as you will learn. He has a unique system for papers that I liked. He is a big fan of short papers. He very much facilitates discussion and supports students as they explore issues. He is great at summarizing arguments. Great use of your Philosophy GE.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL030H,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,No,"Locke is phenomenal. I took his Honors Philosophy class as a GE and loved it! Readings are short, and the class is almost completely discussion based after the first 2 weeks. You will LEARN how to write. If you go to office hours for your papers and learn from your mistakes, you will do well.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL38,4.0,4.0,,,,No,He is so wonderful! The class is a lot of very interesting discussion and he is willing to explain things until they make sense to everyone. The essays are tough but if you go to office hours and ask questions he is more than willing to help. By far my favorite professor.,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,Mandatory,
 PHIL030H,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Being in Locke's class was great. Class is heavily discussion based. The course is tough but Professor Locke is always available during office hours and there is often a long line waiting. He gives useful feedback and great guidance on how to write your papers,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30H,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Locke is one of my favorite teachers at CMC. He tried out a funky grading style on our class which required a lot of work, but my writing has improved exponentially as a result. He'll talk you through the entire paper if you're having trouble writing it too.  He's great in class too, he's funny and brilliant. Highly recommend!",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"The man is extraordinarily intelligent.  He is clear, concise, and demands the same from his students.  He is arrogant, which is off-putting at the start, but becomes a unique addition that makes him memorable.  Great teacher, if you wish to learn how to write, take him and go to office hours religiously to work on your papers",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL136,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Professor Locke is an EXCELLENT professor - one of the best I've had at CMC. His classes are certainly difficult but worthwhile. He grades you hard throughout the semester to push you, but his final grades are very generous. If you actually want to learn something and improve, take his class.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL136,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Locke is great. He is a terrific philosophy teacher -- he really cares that you learn and that you understand what's going on. His ""coach"" attitude towards philosophy is helpful for non-majors. He's funny and acerbic, which makes classes fun. No, he's not that easy, but if you were looking to coast thru college, you would have gone to Pomona.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL136,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"As a Government major w/ only 2 prior Phil classes (Intro and Logic), I found Locke's class incredibly accessible, interesting and worthwhile. Locke is one of the best professors I've ever had when it comes to explaining complicated arguments and responding to student objections. Take his classes if you want to excercise your mind.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL136,4.5,4.0,,,,No,Professor Locke is an amazing Professor.  It is true that he has high expectations but his goal is not to weed people out of his class.  He genuinely loos for the best in his students and helps you to understand your strengths as well.  He is also really entertaining.  I never missed class once because I would rather be there than not.,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,I actually really enjoyed this class. I thought the discussions topics were extremely interesting and challenging. He is definitely a hard grader though but very willing to help during office hours. I took this class as a GE and I don't regret it at all.,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Before taking his class I was considering majoring in PPE. After experiencing this class for 3 weeks, I was really turned off of Philosophy. His grading style is unreasonable, and he expects you to be top rate philosophers in everyday class discussion.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Professor Locke is way too focused on weeding out the non philosophy majors. And because of this, he makes his class extremely difficult, nearly impossible, to do well in.Expectations are way too high! He can be interesting from time to time though, but DO NOT take him to fulfill a GE. BE CAUTIOUS.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,2.0,5.0,,,,No,"Locke is the worst professor I've ever had at CMC.  He doesn't like to help students, and he will kick you out of office hours if he's sick of helping you.  The only reason I attended class was because 30% of the grade was based on participation... and because he's attractive.  Even still, I don't recommend his class to anyone.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL030,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Professor Locke has unreasonable expectations.  This class is intentionally designed to weed out non-Philosophy majors, and it discourages those who are considering.  Most of the readings are interesting but his ""I'm always right"" attitude and unwillingness to help students understand makes the class miserable.  Don't take his class as a GE.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL118,4.5,5.0,,,,No,"Locke is a difficult professor but totally worth it. He is really dedicated to his students and really good in office hours. He expects a lot, but if you're interested in Philosophy he's awesome. Also, extremely clear when you see him during office hours.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Locke is super hard. The class moves very fast and he thinks that everyone is keeping up when in reality only a few are. Can be condescending and slightly rude. Absences result in a lowered grade. Hard grader, high expectations, do not recommend unless you're a philosophy major or are very interested in philosophy.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 PHIL30,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Cool guy, but relies too heavily on philisophical theories and less on inspire though which makes the essays hard.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department,,
 SPAN033,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Class is easy, with very little homework. She does not teach one bit though. Basically, has us read over a new topic at night, we do the homework, and she tells us if our answers are correct or not. Doesn't explain or teach it at all which is very tough at times. Also said the class never did good on tests but never had a curve.",Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN033,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,This was my 6th year of Spanish and Professor Altamirano was the best Spanish teacher I've ever had by a lot. She's super chill and is really clear about what will be on exams. Can't recommend her enough!,Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 SPAN033,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Learning is done ONLY for homework and is barely reviewed in class which is not only not accessible for a lot of students, but also leaves every student in a different spot.

 SPAN44,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Great readings from different Spanish-speaking cultures. Shares such insightful thoughts! Speaks only in Spanish and is easy to understand.

We watch movies!",Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 SPAN44,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I adore Altamirano.

 SPAN033,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Altamirano is a fair grader who really cares about her students.

Really wants you learn, makes you feel comfortable askng questions.",Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN44,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great prof! I've been taking Spanish for 7 years and none of my professors compare to her.

 GOV20,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"As far as Government professors goes, I would venture to say Pitney could very well be the best in the nation. It is a fact that he is ""the most quoted political science professor in the nation.""  If you ever listen to NPR news, he will most likely be quoted in it. Beyond that his teaching is amazing; he spends an absurd amount of time on students",John J. Pitney ,Government department,,
 GOV20H,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Pitney is a great guy. The class was the most intimidating I've had at the beginning, especially first semester freshman year.

 USCONG,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Like Prof Massoud, Prof. Pitney is one of the institutions that make CMC what it is. If you are a Gov major, you must take his class.

 GOV20,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor. Really interested in American Government and wants you to be too, but at the same time realizes that it is a GE. Really open to both left and right thinking. Is super helpful. Go to his office hours during the first week of school, and he will totally help you out. Final reserch paper is hard, but rewarding.",Ken Miller ,Government department,,
 CAPOL,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Miller is the go-to guy on state/local gov. CA Politics is an excellent overview of the big issues facing CA, and is a must for those considering work in Sacramento (ask him about Capital Fellows). He's probably the most moderate faculty member and one of the easiest to approach. If you have trouble, go to office hours - he wants you to do well.",Ken Miller ,Government department,,
 GOV90,5.0,3.0,,,,,"He's a genius and a stud. Challenging material, but he does a great job teaching it.",Ken Miller ,Government department,,

 GOV20,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Appears dull at first, but grows on you. This knowledgeable government professor has been there, done that: DC semester while at Pomona College, State Senate fellow, Harvard grad school, lobbyist in Sacramento, etc. Very fair, passionate, helpful, laid back.",Ken Miller ,Government department,,
 GOV20,4.5,4.0,,,,,"Bright young guy, does a great job of keeping the class both currently relevant and 100% comfortable for right and left views. The field research project is a **** without a car, but worth it. Fun debates. Tests are tough but he threw a sweet study party, cocoa, cookies and everything. Take him!",Ken Miller ,Government department,,
 SPAN001,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,Professor Gonzales has so much energy and this makes the course so engaging.

 SPAN044,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Gonzales' class is the most fun class I've had so far. He assigns lots of textbook activities and small assignments for homework each day, so make sure to stay on top of that, but then you're fine. No final, just 2 big noncumulative midterms. If you're struggling, go to office hours! He's really caring and will do his best to help.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,Yes
 SPAN33,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Nice guy. Your grade is made up of SO many small components (homework, written tasks, pair presentation, participation) that you just have to show up and do the work. 3 midterms, no cumulative final-very reasonable. Willing to help in office hours.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 SPAN33,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Best Professor I have had at college. He really cares about you and the class environment. I am very close with everyone in that class now.

 SPAN33,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Carlos is the best Spanish professor I have ever had. He is incredibly caring and I have so much respect for him. He does not teach to get through the curriculum, but because he loves his students. Having not taken Spanish in a few years, it was not the easiest class, but there were clear instructions and I always received help when it was needed.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 SPAN33,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"Such a nice and caring professor. Cares about your development in Spanish and as a person. Every piece of work you have to do is carefully considered to help you master the language. Furthermore, his office hours are extremely helpful. Language is not easy for me so that is why I made it difficult.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 SPAN33,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Carlos is the bomb!! Super fun teacher who really loves and cares about each and every one of his students.  He's a very understanding person and I would love to take more classes with him.,Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,Mandatory,
 SPAN022,3.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The class is not hard, tests are very fair and not much HW at all. He is a great guy, but not the best teacher ever.

 SPANISH101,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Senor Carlos is one of the best professors/ teachers I've ever had. He allows you to joke around in class, and have fun. His tests aren't hard at all, and as long as you've had a little bit of spanish before you'll be alright.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN125,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"There's a fine line between ""it's part of the culture"" and inappropriate; the last time Gonzales saw that line, he was still living in Peru. Any time work by a female poet is read, Gonzalez lectures on how mysterious/delicate women are, and how they truly have all the power. Otherwise, he speaks mostly English in class and grades arbitrarily.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN22,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Gonzales is a great guy! The class is so fun, and he really cares about the students. I recommend him to everyone taking Spanish at CMC.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,

His accent can be hard to understand at times, but get on his good side, and you'll have a great class. I'm really bummed I can't take more classes with this guy.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN031,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Senor is a lot of fun. Our class was pretty tight because Gonzales is a fun guy. He's a bit difficult to understand in class, and you really have to focus to pick up on what he's saying because he goes over things pretty quickly. All in all he's a good teacher, tests are fair, presentations are simple, and class is fun with Carlos.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN33,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"unless youre interested in being taught by a guy who's less intelligible than ozzie guillen, taking this class is a waste of your time and money. flatly refuses to post anything on sakai even though he inundates you with handouts and other various junk.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPNSH33,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great prof.  Daily homework is optional, with a small assignment turned in every 1.5 weeks or so.  Very reasonable work load and he has a good sense of humor.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN148,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"At first this class seems boring.. but hang in there.  Prof. Gonzales is a caring and dedicated professor that wants his students to succeed - if you do well in his class, a good rec. letter will follow... as well as a much greater enjoyment of Spanish Literature.  NOTE: much of the handouts he gives are missable... just do the daily work and enjoy",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN33,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Spanish 33 was an easy class, but he's not a very good teacher. He doesn't explain a lot of things very well, but the workload is relatively light and the tests are super easy. A few projects, but he gives you ridiculous amounts of time in which to do them. I recommend this professor for span33.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN101,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very helpful during office hours, slightly incomprehensible in class. Do *not* take this class if you place into it without having taken Spanish 44--bad idea.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN101,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,No Comments,Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN33,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,work load high just like any span33 class but he grades really nice. tests are hard but he will basically give it to you in a pretest and will clarify it if you go to office hours-this really helped me. i would recommend him to anybody,Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,
 SPAN33,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"I found this class very easy, but I know others in the class found it very difficult.  It was kind of a drag though, having to go to class 5 times a week.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department,,

 FWS010,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Schur is very clear with the layout of his grading and his course immediately. It is writing heavy, however, you are not actually graded on your writing. Rather, you are graded for submission but still receive great feedback from both your peers and Professor Schur on your pieces. Participation is very important. Easy to do well.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,4.0,2.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"The course's structure seemed perfect for FWS: we would write 750+word pieces every week and then discuss them in class. Prof Schur's feedback is sometimes not supported by anyone else, which is confusing, but he doesn't consider it to be the only right one, so it's fine. Papers weren't graded - just write them, attend classes, and you'll get an A.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Professor Schur's Writing & Experience FWS was one of the more unique classes I have taken. As long as you are active in class and meet the 750 word count each week, you will get an A-. In terms of the feedback I got, I agreed with only some of what he offered. He opened up as the semester went on, and seems to be a really nice guy.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,Yes
 LIT130,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Class was graded on completion so if you did all the weekly assignments/showed up to every class you get an A. Assigned a wide range of movies and I genuinely learned so much about film! He has an interesting/quiet demeanor but he's funny and loves hearing what his students have to say. HIGHLY recommend if you like talking about movies.,Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,C+,No,"Most of his classes are discussion based, so make sure to read the material in advance. You can get by with just Sparksnoting. Bearing in mind my C+ grade, I probably should I have gotten an F for missing most classes and not handing in major assignments. His class is easy which will make you more interested in learning the material.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT130,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Best prof I've had at CMC. Cares so much about the learning of his students. It's a challenging class but it really makes you think.,Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 LIT130,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,Yes,"Great Professor, really knows his stuff; however, it seems like you cant give him enough. I gave him A quality participation and got B+ on my papers and final, but ended up with a B+ in the course. All this despite attending office hours weekly and participating and utilizing his feedback.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,4.0,5.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"It seems like participation matters in this class because he is so engaging and caring towards students, but the class is graded on 4 papers and not much else. I consistently got B's on all of my papers EVEN THOUGH I went into office hours constantly and applied ALL feedback given. I honestly feel worse about my writing after taking this class.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,,
 LIT130,3.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Very participation heavy, which I personally wasn't a fan of but many people enjoyed. Workload is manageable, with a lot of reading/short papers during the first few weeks of the semester and then just short blog posts for the rest of the semester.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Great guy and the class is pretty much completion. Just pay attention in class, do your corrections, and you'll do well.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,,
 LIT130,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Not a bad professor. Has a little quirk and quiet demeanor to him. Likes smart students that participate with smart comments. Does not like grading so he will give work that is generally completion. Lots of reading in the first half of the class that is hard to understand. You will probably fall asleep if you're not engaged. But u won't if you are,Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I am a international student and a freshman. I definitely recommend his class. He knows how to teach and how to teach wisely about writing. More than that, I love him because he is such a knowledgable,  ""mysterious"" man. He is really a writer, thinker. He is so much like Kafka. Take his class and You will be amazed by literature!!!",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,If you go to his office hours he will make sure to give you extra time and help you out as much as he can with precision.

 FWS,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,Took him for FWS. Very little reading with 5 short essays (2-3 pages) and one final essay (8-10 pages). Really nice guy who was very helpful in class and during office hours. At times I was confused by his grading on certain assignments but I would definitely recommend his class,Thomas Schur ,Literature department,,
 LIT130,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Extremely helpful professor. Go talk to him during office hours, it will be worth the time. It's easy to get a B+, but you'll have to work for an A. He is also very chill and friendly. I like to just go talk about the movie that I watched over the weekend. ",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 FWS,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very helpful outside of class, and a good discussion leader. Workload is light - only 3 decent papers, participation, and another assignment. Interesting readings and overall a good course. Go talk to him if you want to make the most out of the class.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department,Mandatory,
 CSCI036,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Cannon had a very well structured class and grading rubric. There is a lot of HW, but the class is very easy if you attention and keep up with the material.

 MATH055,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Cannon's Discrete Mathematics class was very engagingshe taught the course material quite well and clearly, so I had a great understanding of the grading criteria and explanation.

I would highly recommend!",Sarah Cannon ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,Yes
 MATH55,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,C+,No,"Prof cannon is a really great professor! Her lectures are clear and she explains things really well. I took her for discrete. I will say she is a tough grader and not very lenient with simple mistakes. She assigns a ton of hw, in the end I learned a lot but ended with a c plus because shes just a hard grader.",Sarah Cannon ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,Yes
 MATH151,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Probability gets hard near the end, but in general, it is at the lower end in difficulty among math courses.

I feel I like probabilities after taking this class.",Sarah Cannon ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 CALC30,3.0,2.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"If you have not taken calc before, I would be a little weary of taking mistry's class as he can be a bit scattered but overall, such a nice man. I did poorly on a midterm and he gave me 10 points back after I met with him. He is not here to fail you and wants to be as helpful as possible. I didn't learn much in the class but did in my 1:1 meeting.",Bhaven Mistry ,Mathematics department,Mandatory,
 CALC30,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"great prof who isn't here to fail you. extremely generous when it comes to making sure our tests are fair and he's rly funny. would ABSOLUTELY recommend him if you've taken calc before; but even if you haven't, if you pay attention you'll do fine. he'd be great for a higher level math class if he decides to teach one",Bhaven Mistry ,Mathematics department,,
 MATH030,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Can be a little challenging if you've never done calc before but if you have, it is an extremely easy A. There is one group project and three midterms, all of which are extremely simple.",Bhaven Mistry ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 CALC030,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"The math profs at CMC aren't the best but I'd say that Prof Mistry is a decent choice. He's very caring and you can tell that he loves math, but sometimes, he unnecessarily goes into the theory behind simple concepts which may make it confusing for people who are learning calc for the first time. Overall a solid choice though",Bhaven Mistry ,Mathematics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON50,4.0,4.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"SUPER nice but do not take if econ isn't your thing or you've never taken econ before, he moves much faster than other econ profs and his tests are confusing for someone who's never taken it before, but genuinely a great engaging lecturer",Yong Kim ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 ECON50,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Prof Kim is a hard grader on midterms but if you put in the work and communicate with him if you're struggling, your final grade will reflect your work more than the previous grades you received.

 ECON50,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"super nice prof, holds tons of office hours and increases availability before exams; organized, but sometimes he loses track of time; make sure you go over the slides THOROUGHLY esp if u haven't taken econ before bc it can get tricky, but put in the work (aka GO TO OFFICE HRS) and he will notice it; also offers LOTS of resources before each exam",Yong Kim ,Economics department,,
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Kim is the best! 2 midterms, 1 group presentation, 1 final. Everything on the test is in his lecture notes which he gives to you on sakai.

The content was straightforward, math was fairly simple, and you didn't even have to go to class.",Yong Kim ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"One of the best experiences I have had with a teacher, extremely caring very good at explaining concepts and very accessible. I took Macro with him and although the material was a bit dry I enjoyed every class.",Yong Kim ,Economics department,Mandatory,
 RLST087,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Take a class with Prof Gilbert!! He is insanely knowledgable and very unbiased in his teaching. This is honestly one of the best classes I've taken in college.

Learned SO much",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,Not Mandatory,
 RLST21,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Gilbert is very engaging in class and accessible outside of class. Very understanding and willing to grant extensions.

 RLST21,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Gilbert is incredibly knowledgeable about Jewish Civilization. The class is incredibly broad in scope, so we are constantly rushing through the material.

 RLST21,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"On the one hand, the final project for this class was the most work I've ever done for a homework assignment, and took more time than some of the other entire classes I've taken.

Very understanding as long as you communicate with him, has good vibes.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,Mandatory,
 RLST135,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"I was mislead when looking at RLST classes. Here is the truth. Professor Gilbert is caring, intelligent, and the most boring lecturer I've ever encountered. He has an uncanny ability to reiterate the same fact several times without noticing which makes class a dreary endeavor at its best, and downright tortuous at its worst. Caring, easy, BORING!",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Gilbert has been one of my favorite professors so far, taking my Freshman Humanities Seminar with him on Natures of the Self.

 FHS010,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"He assigned 8 essays for the semester, but 6 of them were short and the other 2 were the midterm and the final.

I definitely would recommend.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,Mandatory,
 RLST087,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"Engaging lectures every class with some (not a lot) of students participation.

 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Prof Gilbert is one of my favorite profs here. His FHS was a lot of reading but the discussions are very thought provoking.

Wish I had taken more cool random classes like this during my four years.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,Mandatory,
 RLST055,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,Gilbert is a great person and professor. He is passionate about the subject. But he rushes through many topics to cover everything he wants to cover.

 RLST055,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Great lecturer, clearly extremely knowledgeable on the subjects of the class. Assigned readings are recommended but not necessarily required.

 RLST163,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Gilbert is a wealth of knowledge on Jewish topics from antiquity to contemporary issues.

Interesting subject material with cool analysis.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,Mandatory,
 RLST055,5.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"I love him and his class, definitely would like to take another class with him.

 RLST136,3.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,"While Prof. Gilbert is very knowledgable in his area and is obviously very intelligent, his assignments can be vague while looking straightforward in disguise.

",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,,
 RLST055,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Took it for GE but Prof Gilbert totally made want to be a RLST major! Class is lecture based but he raises interesting questions for you to think about.

Take a class with him if you ever have the chance!,Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,,
 RLST135,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Gilbert has a great wealth of knowledge and experience in his field - he is superbly qualified.

 RLST129,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I would make sure to stay away from this professor. There is a lot of reading, a lot of work, a fair amount of essays, and the grading is based a lot on favoritism.

 HIST168,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Class can sometimes be dry,Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,,
 FHS10,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"All of his classes are discussion based. If you are not writing the text paper about the book discussed in class, then there's no point in going to that specific class. He assigns a lot of writing and a lot of reading, so SparkNotes is your best friend.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,,
 RLST137,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"He is a hard grader, but wants you to do well. Very easy to talk to and barely even looks at his notes.  It can be boring, but it is a lecture class. There is a lot of reading but if you pay attention and take good notes, the readings are not necessary and he wont test you to make sure you did it. I'm thinking about taking another class with him.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,,
 RLST137,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Gary is amazingly knowledgeable, the his lectures are enjoyable, and he is a fair grader.

You will not regret it.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department,,
 RLST137,4.0,4.0,,,,,"He is one my favorite profs. I took the first Jewish-Christian Relations class and learned so much. It was A LOT of reading, but it was doable.

 GOV20,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Favorite Professor yet at Claremont Mckenna College. Most classes were heavily discussion-based. He is available during office hours and will make more office hours if you cannot meet on his specific date. Truly enjoyed every class. I recommend taking a class with him!!,Michael Fortner ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV020,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"The class isn't particularly difficult to pass but Blitz only lectures from a set of notes that seem reused every semester. He's not engaging at all and speaks in a very quiet monotone manner, making it incredibly difficult to engage in the class. Overall, I'd say the hardest part about this class is not falling asleep.",Mark Blitz ,Government department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,A,No,"Professor Blitz's class was mostly lecture, which made it fairly monotonous. Even though the class was a Humanities class, the emphasis was on regurgitating the professor's ideas rather than exploring new ideas together. Be sure to ask questions of the professor to stay engaged.",Mark Blitz ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV020,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,No,"If you're looking to just get the gov GE out of the way - this is a good class to take. The lectures are dry and it's hard to stay interested, but there was no homework. It's all good if you read the books, and if you've taken a general gov class in high school, the material will basically be a recap.",Mark Blitz ,Government department,,
 GOV020,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"Professor Blitz was a good intro to gov prof, but his lectures were very long and dry (this does mean you don't have to do your reading outside of class though).

 GOV020,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"Bright and knowledgeable but lecture intensive, dry, boring, and too monotonous. Appears he follows the same script every year. No class intimacy or fun times. Class engagement is dry too, and he makes little effort to break ice. Too many readings - easier to finesse with summaries, that's how I made it.",Mark Blitz ,Government department,Mandatory,Yes
 GOV020,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,B+,Yes,"Avoid this professor at all costs. His lectures are beyond boring, and he reads directly from his notes the entire class without engaging students.

 GOV20,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Pro: He makes you understand the material and reading. You will learn a ton. Con: Generally boring class periods. He isn't too nice and he has high grading expectations.

 GOV080,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Extremely bright yet extremely boring.  I think he uses the same lectures every year.  He KNOWS all of the text, by heart, and wants you to know and understand them as well.  That being said, he does not want you to fail.  He's kind, but certainly not for every one.  Unfortunate, considering that the other section of this class is taught by a nut.",Mark Blitz ,Government department,,
 GOV80,3.5,1.0,,,,,"Long, droning lectures are a bit difficult to get through, but you have GOT to go to class to do well in this class.

 GOV80,4.0,3.0,,,,,Tendency to be monotone but guy is incredibly intelligent and willing to help. Exams are not too difficult but the final is sort-a evil. Requires a ton of reading. Go to class and all books wil make sense.,Mark Blitz ,Government department,,
 GOVT80,3.5,5.0,,,,,"Not only does he expect you to read all 7 long political philosophy texts, he suggests that students reread them all before the final.  You should also be sure to attend every single day of boring lecture if you want to do well.",Mark Blitz ,Government department,,
 GOV020,2.0,2.0,,,,,"very, very boring, he knows his stuff, but if you can sit through his class, youre a stronger person than I, his voice is a v. annoying monotone. He also has a tendency to clutch, or lean against, or otherwise grope his podium.",Mark Blitz ,Government department,,

 GOV80,3.0,4.0,,,,,He's okay. Lot's of works covered. He lulls you into complacency by spending too much time on the Republic and then expects you to read over 30 chapters of Hobbes' Leviathan in a week later in the semester.,Mark Blitz ,Government department,,

 FHS10,4.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,No,"easy hw & good discussions, but wasn't always clear abt what he wants. 3 essays throughout the semester that are graded relatively harshly. i always made sure to follow his instructions on the syllabus so i did fine, but the class averages displayed on sakai stayed in the B/B+ range for each assignment. hard to tell what your final grade will be",Derik Smith ,Literature department,Mandatory,

 FWS10,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Opens your eyes to the world of film and the domestic/global perspectives that go into the internalized and externalized racism in Hollywood.

 LIT099A,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Smith is hands down one of the best professors at CMC. He kept a really heavy topic of the carceral state super engaging and his deep knowledge of how the world works convinced me to embrace the principles of abolition.

 LIT099B,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I made an account on ratemyprofs just to give him a good review. He is truly an incredible person, brilliant and so very kind.

Stellar, 10/10",Derik Smith ,Literature department,,
 LIT99B,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"He is fantastic. Super smart, funny, chill guy. He puts a lot of effort into planning classes and assigns great readings.

It was very weird",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department,,

Aint nothin wrong w/ that!",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department,,

 GOVT20,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Muravchik is very nice, but it seemed like she struggled with not having enough time to prepare the curriculum for this class.

That's not horrible (it was fun), but I would have liked more basics.",Stephanie Muravchik ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOVT020,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I loved this class with Dr. Muravchik. We read more modern texts and got to talk about modern issues, instead of focusing a ton on philosophers like Tocqueville (we did a little of that too).

The homework readings were way too much and not realistic at all, but you can get through the class without reading much.

Participation wasn't that important",Andrew Busch ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOVT191,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"NOTE: I took this course online. Professor Busch assigns a lot of readings and a 20 page paper in addition to 5 3-page papers as part of the final.

The class is difficult and a lot of work, but absolutely worth taking.",Andrew Busch ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV020,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Busch is a solid option for Gov020. Short, bi-weekly essays about the material + a comprehensive final (no midterm!).

 GOV020,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Prof. Busch is amazing. He is so sweet and I loved his lectures (his Gov 20 class isnt really discussion based).

 GOV020,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Really enjoyed this class - I'd 100% pick him as a gov20 prof for 2 reasons. 1 because he knows his stuff and it's really interesting to hear him talk about it (gov department chair & rose head) and 2 because it isn't that much works (readings are pretty much optional, and midterm is take home). Overall, I really enjoyed the class and am learning!",Andrew Busch ,Government department,Not Mandatory,
 GOV020,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Busch was fantastic. Although there were a decent amount of papers, they were two pages and had clear guidelines on what to do to be successful on them.

 GOVT020,4.0,1.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"Overall good class and good professor. Super nice guy. His lectures are really boring despite my interest in government.

",Andrew Busch ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV20,4.5,3.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"I love Busch - I think his lectures can be a little boring, but it's Gov class where you LEARN GOV.

He's an easy grader if you're straightforward and answer his questions properly - and he's super helpful in office hours - will literally give answers!",Andrew Busch ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV020,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Class is lecture style, but Professor Busch does consistently ask questions about the reading and looks for students to participate. Assigns 6-8 two page papers, take home mid-term, and final. Tough grader, but looks for connections made between the paper topic and the overarching themes covered in class. Very nice, approachable professor",Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 GOVT20,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof Busch is the man. He truly loves the subject, and that shows through his cheery disposition and constant puns. Though it's hard to above an A-, he gives ample opportunity for students to earn a good grade. He assigns 8 one to two page papers (you only have to do six of the eight) about every week and half, then a take home final and midterm",Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 GOV20,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Busch always seems to be in a good mood and because of this gives interesting lectures.  Very easy to pay attention in his class.  Really hard to get an A, but an A- or B+ is completely feasible if you put the work in.",Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 GOV20,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Busch is a great guy. His class is pretty interesting, yet has a tendency to get a tad boring at times.

Highly recommend",Andrew Busch ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV20,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Busch is an awesome guy. He is really into the subject that he teaches, and knows pretty much everything about American politics.

Take his class though, I learned a lot!",Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 GOVT020,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof Busch is a very nice guy and he picks pretty good readings.

 GOVT20,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Busch is a great professor. He's the head of the Gov department and the head of the Rose Institute so obviously he's very knowledgeable and passionate.

Quite a few short papers (about one a week).",Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 GOV20,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor. Extremely intelligent, and tries to engage the class in discussion. Tells government-y jokes and tries to make class as interesting as possible. Assigns 8 papers in a semester (which means almost weekly) but they're only a page or two long so not that big of a deal. The midterm is a take home written midterm. Would recommend.",Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 GOV20,3.5,3.0,,,,No,Very nice teacher but i strongly recommend not taking this class. It is a ton of work and difficult to get a solid A. You wont get below a B+ but its not worth it.  Something like 20 or more papers. He knows what he is talking about and is very excited but lectures dont help on essays so they are kinda useless making it boring. Just not worth it,Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 ,2.5,2.0,,,,,,Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 GOV20,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"First of all, he is a great teacher, encourages you to speak and share! It was fun to be in class.  But, i worked really really hard, and didn't get the solid A.

I don't think there was any chance of getting a low grade... but still, for the amount of work you do, I felt a bit angry when i got my grade.",Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 GOV191,4.5,3.0,,,,,"Very very good lecturer.

 REAGANCLASS,3.0,2.0,,,,,"He's the nicest guy and such an intelligent prof.  He obviously knows his stuff.  He makes the best puns/cheesy jokes (especially when Walter Mondale is involved).

 GOV130,4.0,3.0,,,,,I didn't read a single book for his class and got by fine.

His lectures are interesting and he is funny in that goofy sort of way.,Andrew Busch ,Government department,,
 GOVT130,4.0,5.0,,,,,"Going into this class as a freshman made my life very stressful! Although I did very well in the class and on the papers, it was because I put HOURS into studying and writing.

 GOV130,1.0,4.0,,,,,"He requires a lot of writing (4 papers with a 10-15 page final paper and an exam) He is not helpful. He doesn't check his e-mail and he isn't very prepared for class.

Go to office hours! Good professor, even better person.",Sierra Williams ,Chemistry department,Not Mandatory,
 CHEM116,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"I did well in this class, but not due to any ""instruction"" I received. As it was Prof. Williams' first year, I and my peers tried to be respectful and patient members of her class.

 CHEM116,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Considering it was her first year teaching, I think Professor Williams did a great job.

 CHEM116,1.0,1.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Do not take this course unless you don't want to learn organic chemistry. Prof Williams goes super fast and does not teach well. Tough grader gives no partial credit.

I do not recommend taking her class.",Sierra Williams ,Chemistry department,,

 ECON86,4.5,5.0,,,,No,"He cares more about his students and making sure we actually LEARN the material than any other teacher I can imagine.

 ECON86,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Despite the great reviews, I think Massoud sucks.

 ECON086,4.5,5.0,,,,No,"Massoud is a legendary professor at CMC, but he's not for everyone. He designs the course so that almost everyone fails the second midterm, but he always curves it out in the end, and if you go to his office hours a few times and work with him, it's very easy to get on his good side and make things easier. Be prepared to do a lot of work though.",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department,,
 ECON086,4.5,5.0,,,,No,"Massoud is a legend, and pretty much the reason I came to CMC. He's one of the hardest professors in the RDS but always fair, and you can go and talk to him about anything.

 PSYC37,1.5,4.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"I took the class because a number of alums told me that this was the best class they took at CMC. Ended up being the worst class I ever took in college - workload and difficulty aside, the class was boring and I didn't learn anything.

 PSYC37,3.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"two midterms, one final, one group project composed of a group paper and a group presentation. if you're looking for an easy A you're better off taking the same class offered by a different professor. riggio is nitpicky when grading the exams/project and his rubrics are unclear.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department,,
 PSYC37,2.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Riggio was helpful outside of class though you don't need much help for this class (just read the textbook). His comments in class were often different from the textbook that he wrote, which was confusing. Not an amazing lecturer but does not ask for participation so it's all good. People just end up doing their own thing in class.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department,Not Mandatory,
 PSY37,1.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,The lectures were long and boring. No one was paying attention or even showing up to the class by the end of the semester.

Not a hard subject but the way Riggio teaches the class ruins it all.,Ron Riggio ,Psychology department,Not Mandatory,
 PSYC037,1.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Riggio was not helpful in or out of class. His grading was very unclear and subjective. Although I attended almost all of his lectures, read through his $200 textbook, and did well on the tests, I learned nothing new or useful from this class. Definitely do not recommend.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department,,
 37,4.5,1.0,Yes,,,Yes,"This class was a lot of fun.  It wasn't difficult at all; I think this is mainly due to the subject matter.  That being said, I think it is super informative and important.

 GOV80,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,Ive taken two classes with Nadon and still dont know what he thinks himself about the many topics covered in class.

This is why I came to college.,Christopher Nadon ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV80,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Nadons class is basically caffeine. He actively chooses to have a morning class, but dont worry because its always interesting.

 GOV80,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Amazing teacher. Teaches political philosophy in the way that I was used to taking literature classes. All about textual analysis and extrapolation. So exciting being able to see works like the Republic completely differently after reading them a few times. The meaning changes so much. Calls everyone by last name which I thought was cool.,Christopher Nadon ,Government department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"Mr. Nadon is no doubt a very knowledgable man. But, he is very closed off with his opinions and does not allow for much diversity in the class.

Also, Mr. Nadon cold calls on students which is intimidating.",Christopher Nadon ,Government department,Mandatory,
 FHS010,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Professor's teaching style consists interrupting students during discussion to get his point across.

However, likes to show off how smart he is and pick on others.",Christopher Nadon ,Government department,Mandatory,
 GOV80,4.5,3.0,,,,No,"The classes are all discussion based, but this makes for great classes considering it's Nadon.

I'd completely recommend if you like engaging discussion!",Christopher Nadon ,Government department,,

 FHS05,3.5,3.0,,,,No,"Good prof and interesting man. Class consisted of a seminar-style discussion of the readings which ranged from Homer to Jane Austin.

 GOV20,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"This guy is a great Prof who isn't that hard to do well in.  For tests he sends an email with 6 essay questions and says 2 will be the test.

Overall excellent prof.",Christopher Nadon ,Government department,,

 GOVT060,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Loved this class, really interesting, and he's an awesome professor and really cool guy.

 ECON101,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Definitely the worst professors I've had at CMC. His tests are designed to make people fail. He doesn't want to curve. He asked for an evaluation midway through the class, however, he never followed what the students said. The HW assigned is not anywhere near the material we are tested on. The only positive is that he makes extra time for students.",Darren Filson ,Economics department,,

Flexible on due dates/gives extensions.",Meric Keskinel ,Economics department,Not Mandatory,
 ECON050,4.0,1.0,,,,No,"Great professor! Really funny, has an accent, but it only makes the class so much more interesting. Everyone gets 100% on the assignments and the tests are not too hard. Wish he'd stay here permanently",Meric Keskinel ,Economics department,,
